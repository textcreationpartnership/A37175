            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>TO THE COURTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader, and deſirous of Peace, Grace and Peace in CHRIST JESUS.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome yeares ſince wee privatly imparted to <hi>JOHN DURAEUS,</hi> a man learned, godly, and moſt deſirous of the Churches Peace, our advice of procuring Peace, betwixt the Proteſtants. He thought fit to print our Opinion delivered in a Letter, and to preſent it to the view of the World. After the publiſhing whereof, the ſame <hi>DURAEUS,</hi> and alſo other moſt worthy men, were inſtant, and did preſſe me with much earneſtneſſe, that I would ſomewhat more largely, make an inquiry concerning the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of the Catholique Faith, that
<pb facs="tcp:54675:3"/>it might the better appeare, whether or no, the Proteſtants in all theſe agree amongst themſelves: For truly and wiſely they did conceive, that Peace and Vnion could not be made up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, who indite each other, as guilty of violating and overturning the Foundation. But this they did not ſo adviſedly, that they accounted me, a man almoſt ſpent with old age, able to undergo the weight of ſo hard and heavy an imploiment. Therefore I long and often gave the Deniall to ſome of my friends, who deſired it, and were importunate with me, to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſideration of this matter, and conceived this imployment was to bee committed to none, but ſome Divine flouriſhing in his health and ſtrength. Yet I know not how, not long ſince, of its own accord it came into my mind, that it would not be amiſse, if, (to give my ſelfe ſome ſatisfaction,) I ſhould a little meditate with my ſelfe, of
<pb facs="tcp:54675:3"/>the queſtion propounded. Hence came forth this our Diſcourſe, however it be done: Which after that out of our Study, it had come into the hands of ſome friends, whilſt they requeſted it, and I was not unwilling, it came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad into the World. But we will not have this Tractate appeare in publike, unleſſe alſo accompanied with that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which we formerly ſent to <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAEUS.</hi> Which we do, both for the aſfinity of the ſubject matter, which is well nigh the ſame in both, as alſo becauſe the one reflects mutuall clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe on the other. Meane time I am not ignorant on how dangerous a rock he toucheth, who offereth to define Fundamentall Doctrines, or to bound them within certaine limits. But it was enough for my purpoſe, with this our ſleighter worke, to have whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the induſtry of others, to a more full and acurate explaining of this Matter. In the meane time, if thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:54675:4"/>our paines may be any ways uſefull to Peaceable Divines, towards the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of Peace betwixt Proteſtant Churches; for my part let them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them, who the whilſt ſhall enjoy this comfort, that my weake helpe herein hath not been wanting to the Church in distreſſe. Farewell, Brethren in Chriſt, and Prince of Peace, diligently endeavour to procure the Peace of your own Churches.</p>

                  <head>AN EXHORTATION, To Brotherly Communion betwixt the Proteſtant Churches.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST worthy indeed of the conſideration of all godly Divines, is that Speech of God himſelfe in the Prophet <hi>Zachary, Love the Truth, and Peace.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zach. 8.19</note> To which alſo agreeth that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Speake ye the Truth in Love.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephe. 4.15</note> Wee ought not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo farre to tender the Truth, that the care of Peace ſhould be wholly negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, nor to be ambitious of ſuch an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherewith the true Faith is forſaken. Let the Divines therefore which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter each other, pretend what they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54675:5"/>pleaſe of Religion and Faith, they hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily love neither, which love not both; They deſire neither with a godly mind, which deſire not both. For if every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body (as Philoſophers maintaine) no leſſe deſireth its own Unity than its Being; I ſee no reaſon, why that Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and Myſticall body, which we call the Catholique Church, ſhould not with equall affection deſire its own Unity; as being that which if it bee diſſolved, it cannot really ſubſiſt, nor ſo much as in the mind bee conceived. Therefore let us burne with a longing deſire after Truth, as great as poſſibly may be in godly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques: So be it in the meane time we forget not that of <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 12.18.</note> 
                     <hi>If it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as much as in you lieth live peaceably with all men;</hi> I ſay with all men embrace an outward, and civill Peace, with all Chriſtians an Inward, Eccleſiaſticall, and Spirituall. This is the Will of Chriſt himſelfe; This the generall deſire of the Chriſtian Church, that all that beleeve in Chriſt may meet and be joyned together in one Body, yea in one Heart and Minde. Theſe things therefore being thus, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly are thoſe Peace-making Divines
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54675:5"/>to be prayſed of all, who lately employed their paines in making a brotherly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip betwixt the Proteſtant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For my part, would to God, for the Common good, I might give ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which may ſerve to advance ſo holy a work. What I can, I will do at your requeſt, beloved DURAEUS, and I will publiquely produce thoſe things, which very lately came into my mind, whilſt I thought on this matter.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the firſt place I conceive it muſt bee conſidered, whether ſuch an Union of the Reformed Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt themſelves be poſſible, by vertue wherof each ſhould count other not only in the place of Friends, but Brethren; and becauſe of ſuch an Union, ſhould mutually receive, and returne betwixt themſelves all ſignes, effects, and offices, not only of outward Friendſhip, but of Brotherly and Spirituall Communion. For if this moſt neere Union, which we ſo much deſire, be impoſſible, <hi>Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilium nulla eſt obligatio,</hi> There is no tye which obligeth men to endeavour after Impoſſibilities: but if it be poſſible, no excuſe can be made, why ſo holy a thing,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54675:6"/>ſo acceptable to God, ſhould either bee oppoſed, or delayed any longer. Now what I have ſaid, that it muſt bee enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of in the firſt place, whether ſuch a Communion be poſſible: That ought ſo to be underſtood, although the beaten Controverſies ſtill remaine betwixt the private Doctors of particular Churches, which all ſee, and the godly ſigh for, have ſo long diſquieted the German Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                  <p>Although a full and perfect agreement betwixt Divines, is to be wiſhed for in all theſe Controverſies, yet truly it can ſcarce be hoped for, much leſſe effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in one age. That ſo many heads ſhould agree in one opinion. But that the Churches may in the meane time, notwithſtanding theſe Controverſies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend undecided, make up betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a brotherly and holy Communion, may appeare from thence, that as oft as the Divines of both ſides have begun from their ſoules to deſire, and ſeriouſly to attempt it, ſo oft, and ſo much have they effected herein as themſelves were deſirous to effect, and without doubt had brought more to paſſe, if their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54675:6"/>owne want of will had not beene their hinderance.</p>
                  <p>Witneſſe <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe, and the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> betwixt whom whilſt there remained ſome difference of opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Preſence of the Body of Chriſt, a friendly Union was drawn up at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purg.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heſpin. Hiſt. Sacra. Anno</hi> 1529.</note> 
                     <hi>Luther</hi> profeſſing that hee would not grant this prayſe to the adverſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they ſhould be more deſirous to embrace peace and concord than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Which agreement, I know not by what Engines ſomewhat battered and ſhaken, they again renewed; even whilſt <hi>Luther</hi> rejoyced thereat, and counted it neceſſary,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Idem An.</hi> 1537.</note> after he had diligently conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Confeſſion of the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> that they ſhould joyne their hearts and right hands together. But if any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that this agreement was not ſo full and perfect an Union, as that which now we affirme is poſſible to be made; wee deny it not, but adde this moreover; That not the impoſſibility of the thing it ſelfe, but the will of ſome private men, not yet well purged from the froth, and droſſe of ſuſpition, have hindred this worthy, and godly work, from being
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54675:7"/>brought to the finall upſhot and happy perfection.
<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> For as touching <hi>Bucer,</hi> and other principal Divines conſenting with him, they not only requeſted a brotherly &amp; abſolute Communion, but alſo endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to demonſtrate, that it muſt bee done, and omitted no Offices which conduced any thing thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, how poſſible this brotherly Union and Communion is betwixt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches, is witneſſed by that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Polonian Churches, not long ſince made at <hi>Sendomiria,</hi> and hitherto religiouſly obſerved. They could not final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take away all Controverſies, but they could bid farewell to all diſſentions, and eſtabliſh ſo neere a Communion betwixt themſelves, that they refuſed not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit each other into their Congregations, either to the hearing of the Word Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, or receiving of the Sacraments. Which holy and brotherly conjunction of the Polonian Churches, the moſt wiſe Prince Elector <hi>Lewys,</hi> and Count <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> not only by his Letters congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated unto them, but alſo heartily prayed that the God of heaven would graunt the ſame to the German Churches. What
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54675:7"/>therefore was once ſaid to peaceable <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> about the building of the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> That ſay I to all peaceable Divines, about the making of brotherly fellowſhip betwixt Reformed Churches,
<note place="margin">Chron. 22 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Ariſe therefore, ye godly men, and be doing and the Lord bee with you:</hi> Let us not doubt, but that now may be done, which elſewhere all confeſſe hath beene done. But leaſt this vaine ſcare-crow of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility ſhould hinder and delay the endeavours of Princes, Divines, and all pious men in this matter, I will reckon up thoſe obſtacles and impediments, which in very deed doe make the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion betwixt Proteſtant Churches al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together impoſſible, whence it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that no ſuch thing blocks up the way, but that the German Churches, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whilſt theſe controverſies do depend, may enter brotherly Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt themſelves, and may wholly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it when it is entered.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the firſt and greateſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle wherewith Churches, as yet not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in all Queſtions of Divinity, are hindered from meeting together in one, is the uſurped Dominion, which one

                  <p>For if ſome one Church will ſo lord it over the Faith of others, that it will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge none for Brethren, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive none into Communion with it ſelf, ſave ſuch as firſt receive from her Lawes what they ſhould beleeve and ſpeake, there is no hope left of making or keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brotherly Union betwixt ſuch, in the differences about opinions whatſoever. Seeing that the Holy Scripture forbids us in this ſort to make our ſelvs vaſſals to any mortall men: Our only Maſter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids us that we ſhould not in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner acknowledge earthly maſters Lords of our Faith. That Church, which on thoſe termes is received into Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with another Church, gaines not Peace thereby, but enters it ſelfe into a Covenant of moſt unjuſt ſlavery. The Romiſh Church alone, hath arrived at ſuch a height of pride and madneſſe, as to thruſt out all thoſe Churches from the Communion of Saints, and curſe them to the pit of Hell, which refuſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo this Antichriſtian yoke, of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and blind obedience. God of his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54675:8"/>goodneſſe keep this madneſſe of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts farre from Proteſtant Churches; which if it ſhould prevaile in them, it were not lawfull, not indeed to hope, yea not to wiſh this Conjunction of Churches, which all ought to deſire. But (thankes bee to God) it is well known, it is moſt ſure, that all and every one of the Reformed Churches from their whole hearts abhorre their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian ambition of dominiering. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this principall hinderance is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of their way, which uſeth to make an everlaſting Schiſme betwixt thoſe Churches, which as yet agree not in all things, and with the ſame Act ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Union betwixt them in very deed impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond obſtacle, comming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, makes the Union and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of divers Churches (ſuppoſe the <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Helvetian</hi>) impoſſible, as the approving of Idolatrous worſhip on the one ſide, and deteſting it on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Seeing that in <hi>Hoſea</hi> is well known to all the godly,

                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.16.</note> and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite paſſages to the ſame purpoſe. Well ſpake <hi>Tertullian</hi> of this matter, <hi>Idolatry is the principall crime of Mankind, and the highest guilt of any age.</hi> God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo ſeverely commanding, that we ſhould fly from Idols and all Idolatry, though ſhadowed over with what faire pretences ſoever, that is to be counted morally impoſſible which cannot be done without ſome ſtaine of Idolatry, &amp; grievous offending of Gods Majeſty. See here the grand and horrible hinderance, whereby the Reformed Churches are compelled, not without great griefe, and horror of mind to remaine out of the Communion of the Romiſh Church. For they ſo dote on their Idols, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them on others to be adored, that none can come, at leaſt abide in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, except with the ſame deed he will become a moſt manifeſt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolater. If the German Churches could not enter and retaine this holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion betwixt themſelves, but that either they muſt be tyed to the exerciſe of an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous worſhip, or at leaſtwiſe bee
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54675:9"/>bound to beleeve and confeſſe that ſuch a worſhip is not unlawfull, I ſhould not doubt to affirme that ſuch a Communion is impoſſible, which cannot be obtained but on ſuch hard &amp; heinous Conditions, for we can only doe that, which we may doe lawfully, as the Lawyers uſe to ſpeake. But here we have that for which we ought againe and againe to give thanks unto God, who hath made the Reformed Churches, albeit little agreeing in all concluſions of divine knowledge, yet unanimouſly to conſent, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to agree in the condemning and aboliſhing of all Idolatry. If therefore at this very houre the Proteſtant Churches deſire all to meet in one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Communion, not ſo much as the leaſt ſpot or ſtaine of Idolatry were to be feared on either ſide. Away therefore with all pretence of Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility drawn from this Reaſon, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let it make mens mindes or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſtep aſide from this ſo holy a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and deſigne.</p>
                  <p>The third and laſt obſtacle, whence the Communion of divers Churches
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54675:10"/>betwixt themſelves is held impoſſible, is the aſſerting and defending of ſome Fundamentall Article, neceſſary to be known and beleeved to the ſalvation of Chriſtians, on the one ſide, which is ſound and Catholique; and the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and oppoſing the ſame, on the other ſide, which is Hereticall. For to grow together into one with Hereticks ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the foundations of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, is to ſtart off from Chriſt, the Foundation of the Chriſtian Church. Concerning this hinderance, becauſe it is a matter of greateſt moment, we muſt diſpute ſomewhat more largely.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the firſt place, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that is to be counted a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Article, which through the will of God revealing it to the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Salvation and eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is ſo neceſſary to be known and beleeved, that from the Ignorance, and much more from the oppoſing thereof, men runne the manifeſt hazard of loſing eternall Life. This care and charge lyes not upon the Divines of our age, that they ſhould forge new, and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Articles of the Catholique
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54675:10"/>Faith for Chriſtian people. That which was not Fundamentall in the times of the Apoſtles and Primitive Church, cannot with all our Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, wranglings, and Curſings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Fundamentall.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54675:11"/>beſtowed on miſerable ſinners; and thoſe things which flow from thence, the Redemption of mankinde, the Sanctification of Gods peculiar people, the Communion of the Saints betwixt themſelves, the forgivenes of ſinnes, the Reſurrection of the bodyes, and the Glorification of the faithfull. Who ſo believeth all things which we have contained in this ſhort Creed, and endeavours to lead his life conformable to the precepts of Chriſt, is not to be daſhed out of the lift of Chriſtans, nor to be driven from the Communion of other Chriſtians, members of what Church ſoever. On the other ſide, He that filcheth away, or carpeth at any of theſe Articles, though he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth to himſelf the name of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, is to be driven and kept off from the Communion of thoſe which right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeve; yet I acknowledge, that beſides theſe Articles, many Doctrines are contained in the holy Scriptures, &amp; out of the holy Scriptures may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by firme conſequence, which are very profitable to be known, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much to proficiency in Divine

In theſe things if any Church, cannot ſo cleere the truth of her opinion to other Churches as to draw them to the ſame opinion, ſhee ought to caſt off their errors, but ought not to caſt off brotherly Communion with them becauſe of theſe errours. To theſe I adde, that although ſome place of Scripture may ſeem to theſe Churches to eſtabliſh a Fundamentall Article, ſeems not unto others; yet in this diverſity of opinions there is not cauſe juſt enough to break off the Communion, ſo be it both ſides piouſly beleeve the ſame Article and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be cleerly and ſolidly ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on other places of holy Scripture. Laſtly, and this alſo muſt be added, It is neither impoſſible, nor ſwarving from the duty of good Chriſtians, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain communion with thoſe Churches, who ſeem to us to follow ſome opinion which truly cannot hold together with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54675:12"/>a fundamentall Article, ſo be it, as in the meane time, they profeſſe the ſame Article, and with both armes, (as we ſay) embrace it. For it abhors from the rule of Charity, yea from ſound reaſon, that any, for thoſe Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by himſelfe neither underſtood, nor granted, ſhould be conceived to have denied or rejected a fundamentall Article, which he firmly beleeves, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly affirmes, and if need were, would <hi>Seale</hi> and <hi>Signe</hi> the truth thereof with his own blood. More true and favourable is the judgement of a great and peaceable Divine;
<note place="margin">Bucere.</note> It is not our part, to have reſpect to that, which of it ſelfe followeth of any opinion; but to that, which followeth in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, who hold that Point, which we conceive oppoſite to a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Article. For even as he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth any true Principle, doth not preſently believe and underſtand all thoſe things which learned Men by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences may deduce from the ſame; ſo he that holds any falſe opinion doth not inſtantly hold all thoſe things, which thoſe of better ſight do perceive

How farr this ſpreads it ſelfe, and how forcible it is to eſtabliſh brotherly union betwixt Reformed Churches, Wiſe men and lovers of the Peace of the Church, may eaſily obſerve. For if it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Communion onely is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (that is, unlawfull) with thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, which explicity reject any fundamentall Article, or defend an Hereſie which ſtabs the Heart and cuts aſunder Communion with Chriſt himſelfe, that alſo will follow, that this brotherly Communion which we ſo much deſire betwixt the German Churches, may be eſtabliſhes between, Churches which are found, and thoſe which are not ſo well in health; between Churches of a more, and of a leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Standard.

Of infinite other queſtions, which may ariſe, and be canvaſſed betwixt the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Doctors of diſperſed Churches, no Church either required or expected a forme of abſolute conſent from other Churches. For if without this, the brotherly Communion betwixt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, were adjudged im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, to the cementing and ſoder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, we ſhould not ſtand in need of Synodall Epiſtles, or briefe formes of confeſſions, but of huge volumes of controverſies. But if we refuſe to learn of the ancient Fathers; yet now at laſt let us learn of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that the brotherly communion of Mindes, Duties of Courteſie, and Sacraments, is not impoſſible betwixt thoſe Churches which defend contrary opinions, about controverſies never to be decided. I will ſay nothing of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54675:14"/>wranglings of Thomiſts and Scotiſts, nothing of the Dominicans and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites: There is at this day a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie beaten and bandied betwixt the Churches of the Romiſh Religion, of more moment, than all thoſe things, whereabout Proteſtants doe ſtrive, if they were rouled up in one bundle: I mean that of the infallible Judge, in all queſtions of the Chriſtian Faith. The Spaniſh and Italian Churches defend the Pope to be this Supreame Judge, warranted with the irreſiſtable autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, and ſo inſpired and inlightned with the ſpirit of truth, that in all his decrees and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherewith he intendeth to bind the whole Church, he can in no wiſe erre and be deceived. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, the French Churches, cry him downe, juſtle him out of his infallible chaire, and conclude him to be ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to error, that if in matters of faith or manners, he refuſeth to obey and to be ordered by the judgement and Authority of a generall Councell, they voice him, to be counted for a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique, and a Heretick, and one to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54675:14"/>be depoſed: See agreat difference about the very Pillar of the Catholike faith. Yet in this brawling about opinions, there is no breaking off of brotherly communion betwixt the Churches themſelves. Tell it not in <hi>Gath,</hi> nor publiſh it in the ſtreets of <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> that the Philiſtines were more forward than the Iſraelites to preſerve Peace and unity betwixt them. Laſtly, if ſuch controverſies ſhould make an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion betwixt particular Churches im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, I faine would have one ſhew to me, even but two Churches (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one is not ſubject to the other) which muſt not of neceſſity, be alienated, pluckt aſunder, and as it were with a partition wall divided each from other. For except we return to this point, that we only admit and allow of this Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from other Churches, for diſſenting in Fundamentals, the communion of the Catholike Church anciently ſo highly extold,
<note place="margin">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54675:15"/>of the whole world beſides, and onely remained in the party of <hi>Donatus.</hi> The Romaniſts, in this point, are pure down-right <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who ſhout it out, that the Catholikc Church is found only in the part of the Pope of Rome. It is our duty to deteſt ſuch Schiſmaticall wickedneſſe, and to keep and profeſſe brotherly Communion with all Chriſtian Churches, which we adjudge not as yet to be disjoyned from Chriſt the Head by Hereſie, or Idolatry, or not at all to be ſhunned by other Churches, for uſurpation of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
                  <p>What hitherto hath been diſputed about thoſe Obſtacles, which make the communion of divers Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt themſelves impoſſible, and alſo of thoſe different opinions, which no wayes cauſe the ſame; all aime at this end, That if it could be agreed betwixt Divines, that thoſe controverſies which ſo long have troubled and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Proteſtant Churches, are not of ſuch importance, that, whether one come off to this or that ſide in their opinions, he is not to be judged to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54675:15"/>depart from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Faith,</hi> and to fall into a Hereſie contrary to the foundation; we would confeſſe that brotherly union may be made up, and kept betwixt all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches, even whileſt theſe diſſentions rather of the Schooles than the Churches, doe ſtill remaine. It is not my purpoſe to engage my ſelfe in the controverſies themſelves: only I would deſire that the moſt learned and famous Divines of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches would be entreated, with peaceable mindes, and calme affections, to runne over all thoſe controverſies, which are in agitation betwixt them, ſeeing the Judgement periſheth when the matter is paſſed into the affections.

Yet if any ſuſpect, that under this concord of words, ſome Repugnancy of meaning and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion may lye hid, nevertheleſſe this is to be urged, and enquired into, whether this Repugnancy be ſuch and of ſo great moment that it renders the Peace and Unity between Churches impoſſible, and makes the Schiſme and disjoynting betwixt them neceſſary and everlaſting. I know it ſeemeth farre otherwiſe to moſt learned and ſolid Divines, when they ſide not to take part, and are without the Liſts of this diſcord. Now as concerning thoſe controverſies of the Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of his properties, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that firſt may ſeem to have bred, whoſoever ſhall weigh with Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54675:17"/>what is granted, what denyed on both ſides, ſhall preſently perceive, that neither of theſe, nor of thoſe any Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Article is called into queſtion, much leſſe oppoſed, or overthrowne.

                  <p>For the reducing of divers Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che into one communion, I conceive no more fit and convenient way can be thought upon, than that familiar one of appointing a faire and peaceable Conference betwixt Divines choſen by the authority of their Princes. For if any man think, that by calling a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel out of all the Reformed Churches, theſe queſtions, which have employed the wits of moſt learned men theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, may within a few moneths or years, or within one century of years be ſo defined, that the conſent of all men may be obtained in all theſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54675:23"/>heads of controverſall Divinity (be it ſpoken with the good leave of all good men) to me it ſeems ſcarce likely; Seeing the weake eye of Mens mindes hardly pierceth into the nicity of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile controverſies, even when it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys them being in quietneſſe; But if it be, as if it were full of black duſt, rayſed with the motion of Diſputants, for moſt part it cannot ſo much as ſee them, or with a fixed and ſteddy looke behold them. And, to ſpeak the truth, Councels, eſpecially thoſe that are Generall, ought rather to be uſed, for the defending and eſtabliſhing of cleere Articles of the Chriſtian Faith againſt Hereticks, than for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing and defining of hard; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies which are not neceſſary at all. Let us return therefore, to that peaceable, and Brotherly conference, which we lately commended: which if it be appointed with that minde, and mannaged in that manner it ought, we are in great hope very ſhortly to ſee an happy agreement of the <hi>German</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                  <p>This therefore ought firſt to be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54675:23"/>in the minde of all, who are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Conference, that they are not called together, that as adverſaries they ſhould contend; but that as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they ſhould ſeek and follow all lawfull wayes to eſtabliſh Peace. For if they themſelves betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſaw one another, and thinke they muſt revy contentions, they will never perſwade Union and Peace betwixt the Churches at variance: Therefore let them not ſo much as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to enter into the Labyrinths of the wonted diſputations, but let them aime, and direct their meeting to this one marke, that they may ſhew their Churches, that there is no cauſe juſt enough, why they ſhould refuſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Union, and ſo long abhorre from joyning their right-hand of Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. That this may be done, let it be ſtated and determined in the firſt place, concerning every controverſie, what of old was defined by the Suffrages of the Catholique Church, and under the paine of a curſe was to be believed of all.

Now if any ſhould contend that all thoſe things which are diſputed of the Schoolemen, of the Manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and Begetting, are alſo Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, and neceſſary to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on one ſide, verily he by this his raſh Judgement, would gaine no favour with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Chriſts</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. So alſo, <hi>That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is God and Man,</hi> and hath in one Perſon the Humane and D vine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inſeparably united together, and that we owe our Salvation to God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnated,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54675:24"/>is a moſt ſolid Foundation of our Catholique, and ſaving Faith. Notwithſtanding whatſoever may be asked, and diſputed of the unutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable manner of this Union, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, of the manner of the Corporall preſence in the Holy Supper, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, of the properties communicated to the humane nature, by the vertue of the Union, or of the Operations of the humane nature depending on this Union, it doth not preſently belong to Fundamentall Faith, but to skill in Divinity, and perchance not to that neither, but ſometimes to the curioſity of Divines. Let this therefore be the firſt and chiefe care of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines at the conference, accurately to diſtinguiſh and ſever Fundamentalls from thoſe which are not Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; neither to take it for granted, that whatſoever ſeemes to touch and border on a Fundamentall Article is preſently Fundamentall.</p>
                  <p>After they have agreed on theſe things, care muſt be taken that theſe fun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>damentals be expreſſed in few &amp; cleer words, and be propounded to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed

Conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being had in Fundamentalls, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Doctors cannot fully and perfectly agree in other things, yet in this let them all agree, that with one mouth, and heart, they cry out toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to God,</p>

                  <p>But if any here ſhould demand what muſt be done with thoſe controverſies which cannot be compoſed, leaſt by occaſion of theſe the Peace and Union of the Church may either be hindered, or troubled and broken againe after once it is made up, theſe things ſeem to mee muſt be obſerved by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of both parties.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, what things hitherto have been ſpoken or written rather bitterly, and perverſly, than truly, and with good conſideration of the adverſaries in the very heat of contention; Let all thoſe things be mutually pardoned for the publike good, and be buried in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall oblivion. And if ſuch bookes ſhall chance to be reprinted againe; let it not be done, except all the gall be purged out, whence the evill of Brotherly contention may againe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whereas no man can pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently endure to have himſelfe branded with the mark of Hereſie, we muſt take

                  <p>Thirdly, as much as may be, let all hard, and undetermined controverſies be removed from Sermons preached to the people, and bookes written in the Mother tongue, and let them rather be counted amongſt exerciſes fit for the Schoole, then for food for mens Soules.

                  <p>Hitherto we have made the draught of the manner of making Peace and preſerving Union betwixt different Churches, ſtanding upon equall terms of Juriſdiction. But becauſe it may and often doth happen, that ſome both learned, and unlearned may live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of the ſame Prince or Church, which are forbidden by their conſcience, either rightly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54675:28"/>or erroneous, from ſubſcribing to the common judgement in theſe controverſies, let us make enquiry what is to bee done concerning theſe. Now as touching the Miniſters of Churches, if they deſire to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for their weak Brethren in theſe Articles of Religion, or if they be willing that their briefe forms of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion be received, and approved of all ſubject unto them; let them not caſt into them the nice points of difficult controverſies, or deciſions of ſubtile queſtions, but rather, let them be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the popular capacity, the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the unlearned the Salvation of all. They muſt well weigh the wiſdome of our Anceſtours, whoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Confeſſions, if we had not, on ſet purpoſe to diſturb the Church, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lined and ſtuffed with new opinions, no man, well in his wits, would have been found, who would not willingly have ſubſcribed unto them; Neither is there any need at all, that we ſhould clog and burthen the publike confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church with ſuch additions, when God himſelfe hath decreed to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54675:29"/>bring his people to a bleſſed life, not through the rough and rugged places of hard and long queſtions, but by the plaine, even, and ſhort way of Faith and Charity. To what purpoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are diſputes, and ſtrifes about words? What make the ſubtleties of the Schoolemen in the Confeſſions of the Church? All the Salvation of Chriſtians conſiſts in beleeving and worſhipping,
<note place="margin">In orat. u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſſe Chriſtum.</note> as of old it was grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid of great <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> To theſe things it may be added, that they can ſcarce, or not at all preſerve Peace unviolated with other Churches, not at all ſubject unto them, who for the ſame Doctrine they profeſſe, perſecute thoſe which are under them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt to cut them off as Hereticks from their Communion. They may ſeem truly ſilently to upbraid Hereſie to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, and by this very deed to intimate as much, that though with their mouth they acknowledge them for Brethren, yet in their hearts they much deteſt and abhorre them. Laſtly, unleſſe the briefe formes of publike Confeſſion, be reſtrained and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54675:29"/>to doctrines neceſſary, and not to all controverted betwixt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants themſelves; this inconvenience will follow thence, that many Paſtors, learned, pious, and peaceable, will be excluded and quite ſhut out; nor ſhall they be able to doe any ſervice in thoſe Churches in which they live. But if any doubt, whether lawfully they may keep holy Communion amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in one and the ſelfe ſame Church, who embrace not at all one and the ſelf ſame opinion in every reſpect, in all the heads of Doctrine in Divinity, that I indeed conceive ought to be reſolved on, as a thing beyond all reach of doubting. For as pertaining to that holy Communion, which Chriſtians have amongſt themſelves in the Lords Supper, it chiefly conſiſts in theſe things; That with the common band of the holy Spirit, wee are joyned to <hi>Chriſt</hi> the onely head of the Church; That by the tyes of the ſelfe ſame holy Spirit, and ſaving Faith, and Charity, we ſtick together amongſt our ſelves, and as it were are made up into one Body, Laſtly, that as fellow-commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54675:30"/>we eate and drink the ſame living bread, and drink, to wit the fleſh, and blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to the ſalvation of our Soules. In all theſe things they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the ſame Communion, who are admitted to the ſame holy Supper.</p>
                  <p>But in very deed, as by this mutuall Communion, we doe not profeſſe that we all have attained a perfect, or the ſame degree of knowledge in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; ſo neither doe we by this deed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, that we have a perfect conſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our ſelves in all heads of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in Divinity, or altogether the ſame opinion of every queſtion. If the Communion of Chriſtians amongſt themſelves ſhould ſtand on theſe hard termes, ſcarce could <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> have held Communion amongſt themſelves: Sure the Church of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had been broken into ſhivers; but in theſe our times, it had not been eaſie to finde many divines of great credit, who could with a ſafe conſcience be partakers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the Lords Supper. All Rulers therefore of Churches ought, being guilty of their own and the common infirmity, to beware, leaſt whilſt they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54675:30"/>exact &amp; require from their own people, a too harſh, and not at all neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, they ſeem to ſhake and weaken the moſt ſweet and moſt neceſſary Communion of Chriſtians amongſt themſelves. So much concerning the Governors of the Churches? Wee come now to the Miniſters or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtians which deſire Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Chruches, wherein they live, and yet cannot worke upon their conſciences with any entreaties to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and profeſſe all the received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the ſame Church. It ſhall be their duty to afford, and expreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves teachable, and humble, not obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and proud, in the maintaining of thoſe opinion, wherein they ſtep aſide from the common opinion of the Church; but he is to be counted teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and humble, who willingly, and ſubmiſſively lendeth his cares and heart to the Church teaching him, who rejects not the doctrine propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto him, out of a vitious diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Rebellious will, but is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by the weakneſſe of his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that he ſees not the Truth in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54675:31"/>theſe hard controverſies; which thoſe, who are more learned, and accurate, perchance with no difficulty can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. Now becauſe 'tis the priviledge of God alone to ſearch hearts, it is our part ever to encline to the moſt favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſide, and to preſume of every one, where the contrary appeares not by manifeſt evidence, that rather out of conſcience, than ſtubbornneſſe, he is detained and hindred from affording his conſent. They who ſhall behave themſelves in this manner, are not for every ſtubble of erroneous opinion, to be parted and kept off from the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Communion wherein they live. Yet on thoſe terms and conditions they are not to be driven off, if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not at all to oppoſe the common Judgment of the Church, or to extoll and ſpread their private opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people. Nor ought they to take this in ill part, who are deſirous to entertaine Peace, and Eccleſiaſticall Communion; for ſuppoſe the opinion of any private Doctor or Chriſtian to be true, and that to be erroneous, which uſeth to bee defended by the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54675:31"/>Church, yet if the error be in a matter or opinion which hinders not the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Chriſtians, farre better is it that the true opinion of any private Doctor whatſoever lye hid in the dark, than that the publike authority of the Church, bee in the broad light o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly trampled upon, or the Peace of the Church be ſhaken by this altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unneceſſary bickering of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinions, as with the ſtruggling of windes croſſing each other. But if any one perſwadeth himſelfe, that that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which he defends againſt the judgement of the Church, be of ſo great moment, that the Salvation of men doth depend from the knowledge thereof, if he cannot perſwade the ſame to the Rulers of his own Church, he muſt either depart unto another Church, or elſe for the good of the Soules in that Church, to which he is ſubject, patiently to undergoe the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure impoſed upon him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the things, moſt learned <hi>Duraeus,</hi> which I though fit at your requeſt to write, and ſend unto you. If they may be uſefull to you or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54675:32"/>towards the furthering of the Union of the Churches; I have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied mine own deſire and purpoſe. They without doubt may ſuggeſt more, and better things, to whom the preſent eſtate of the <hi>German</hi> Churches is better known, and looked into. This thing alone remaines for me to doe, humbly to pray to the God of Heaven, that he would bow the hearts of Princes, from their Soules to deſire this Union of the Churches; that he would enlighten the mindes of Divines to finde out, and apply thoſe meanes whereby it may fooneſt be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; that he would kindle the hearts of all Chriſtians to embrace, and propagate this Peace to all Poſterity. <hi>The God of peace grant this for his Sounes ſake, our only Mediatour, and Procurer of Peace with the Father: to whom, with the Holy Spirit, be all Honour, Glory and Thankeſgiving for ever and ever, Amen.</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54675:35"/>duties of charity, and fruits of new obedience. Moreover theſe diſſentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Reformed Churches, hinder the more moderate Papiſts (which begin to open their eyes at the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell) from joyning with us, whilſt they obſerve, that we cannot, or (which is worſe) will not joyne among our ſelves. Laſtly, they ſcarce ſeem to acknowledge, that the Goſpel, is the power of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation to every one that beleeveth, who becauſe of theſe controverſies lately ſtarted, make a ſeparation from other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, as if there were no hope of the Salvation of all thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which have not attained an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act knowledge of theſe Controverted points.</p>
                     <p>For my part, I conceive it no great difference, whether we place unwritten Traditions in joint commiſſion with the holy Scriptures, or whether we enforce our Controverſies on all Churches to be knowne and beleeved, under the ſame neceſſity of Salvation, with the ſolid, and manifeſt doctrin of the Goſpel. We ought therfore to beware, leſt whilſt the Paſtors of the Reformed Churches on both ſides,

                     <p>The nature of ſupernaturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and heavenly things, gave the cauſe, or occaſion rather to theſe our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. For as it is eaſie for minds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, and ſanctified to embrace with <hi>Obedience to the Faith,</hi> all things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be knowne to Salvation, which are plainly delivered in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures concerning God and Chriſt, and all things to be beleeved, and practiſed; ſo to deſire to dive deeper into the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Faith than is fitting, and thence to draw conſequences by the help of our Reaſon, and to annexe them to the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Articles, is a matter of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and danger, and the neceſſary occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of contentions. For 'tis impoſſible but that the wits of men, muſt often differ, and ſometimes erre in thoſe things which are collected by the mediation of humane underſtanding. Meane time there is none but dotes on the darlings of his own Braines, as beautifull, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles them to be borne of the Bowels of the Scripture; hating the reaſonings, and inferences of others, as deformed, and ſpringing from the puddles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon corrupted. Thus whilſt men
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54675:37"/>deſire to ſee more in the Myſteries of Faith, than is clearely ſhowne in the Glaſſe of Gods Word, rather the heat of their diſſentions, than light of their knowledge is increaſed.</p>
                     <p>It would apply ſome plaiſter to this ſoare, if the Divines of both ſides would remember, that although all the Articles of the Catholique Faith are plaine, and perſpicuous, (as written in Gods Word with capitall Letters, ſo that he that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth may read them) yet what thence is extracted by the chymiſtry of mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, are divers, and of different kinds, moſt of them ſo obſcure, that they eſcape the eyes of the moſt ſharpe ſighted Divines. We muſt therefore confidently leane with all our weight on what the Scriptures have decided; but not lay ſo much ſtreſſe on the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of our own deduction.

If any could find a cure for this Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diſeaſe, we ſhould preſently ſee many controverſies, and all contentions (at leaſt the bitter and hoſtile ones) pacified and laid a ſleep. But (what is to be bemoand) thoſe Divines, which are too much drawn away with Selfe-love, are by the breath of popular applauſe, and deſire of vaine-glory driven farther than they themſelves at firſt intended, or thought it ever poſſible. For men troubled with this evill, will trouble all things, humane, and Divine, rather than they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelves deceived, or weary of the fight, or overcome by their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Yea, except they may conquer, and carry the adverſe party captive before their Triumphant Chariot, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined continually to claſh the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches together with deadly diſcords. I am not ignorant that all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54675:39"/>the deſire of truth, and Gods Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but that too many continue theſe contentions for the love of vaine-glory, would I might deny it, and at the ſame time ſpeak truth. Surely 'tis ſcarce to be beleeved, that thoſe who muſt needs know what dammage States, Churches, and Mens ſoules (bought with Chriſts pretious bloud) receive from theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions betwixt Proteſtants, can in the midſt of theſe contentions have their eyes only faſtned on the glory of God. Wherefore let the hot diſputants on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide examine their owne Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, whether they perpetuate theſe Controverſies and Diſcords of the Churches, that God may loſe no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or rather that there be not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an apt and laſting matter to their own vaine-glory. Other occaſions, and cauſes of theſe diſſentions, we have no leaſure to recite; but of one wee muſt more largely dilate, which hath made theſe Controverſies as it were he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary, and will make them everlaſting, except God pitying the Proteſtant Churches, put new minds into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors thereof. For this opinion hath poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54675:39"/>the minds of many pious and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Divines, that the matters contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted betwixt Proteſtants are of ſuch moment, that ſuch as are found erroneous therein, are thereby convicted, to ſhake, yea to overturne the very Foundations of the Catholique Faith, and mans Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

                     <p>Foraſmuch therefore as the Church is called the <hi>City of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 122. &amp; 47.</note> 
                        <hi>the Houſe of the Lord,</hi> it muſt have ſome Foundation; on
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54675:40"/>which whilſt it leanes, and relyes, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth ſafe and ſound; from which if it giveth off and ſtarteth aſide, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently periſheth, and is brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It is plaine therefore, that whilſt we ſpeake of the Church founded by God, that hath the name and nature of a <hi>Foundation,</hi> by which all the parts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are ſupported, and from which they borrow both their ſtrength and ſafety. And as in ſome great Aedifice, the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts have not all the ſame ſtrength, &amp; beauty, yea ſome ſomtimes, may ſeem ſomewhat more inclined to fall, which as yet ſtand, and ſtick to the foundation: So in this far ſtretched building, which we call the Houſe, and Church of God; there is great difference of particular Churches. For ſome are fairer and firmer than the reſt, becauſe better and neerer joyned to the Foundation, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſomewhat ruinous, and ſhaken, becauſe not ſo well faſtened to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, yet all, which are not as yet plucked off from the foundation, are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by the ſtrength, and benefit thereof, and are continued to the firmer, and fairer parts of the building.</p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:54675:41"/>
                     <p>Hence it is plaine, when we ſpeak of the Churches, what a kind of thing that is, which challengeth to it ſelf the name of a Foundation. Let us ſee now, retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtill the former Metaphor, what manner of things they be which we uſe to call <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> for this is the word that hath made ſo much work for our Divines, and hindered them in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of the whole buſineſſe of the pacification.</p>
                     <p>But firſt of all, here we muſt obſerve, that a materiall Edifice, built of Wood and Stone, is founded nothing like unto a Spirituall Building, whoſe ſtructure conſiſts of Living Trees, and Stones, that is, of Men enjoying the uſe of their Reaſon and Will. For in this Quick and Lively Building, nothing either hath due conjoyning with, or receiveth any ſtrength from the <hi>Foundation,</hi> except it be coupled thereunto by the Act of the Reaſon, and Knowledge, and by the Act of the wil cleave faſt to it, &amp; obey it. Thoſe things therfore are truly counted and called <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> which being known, Chriſtians may have a ſaving conjunction with their <hi>Foundation,</hi>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:54675:41"/>which they cannot have, if the ſame things be not known, or not beleeved. In like manner if we conſider the <hi>Will,</hi> thoſe ought to be called practicall <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,</hi> by the obſervation, and doing whereof, we may remaine joyned to our <hi>Foundation,</hi> but may not if we diſpiſe, or neglect them. And let <hi>the Knowledge of Chriſtians be never ſo imperfect,</hi> yet if they know and beleeve theſe <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> they ſhall not be parted from the <hi>Foundation,</hi> for the defects of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Let <hi>the righteouſnes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians be never ſo imperfect,</hi> yet if they do theſe practicall Fundamentals, they ſhall not be ſeparated from the Foundation, for the defects of their <hi>good will.</hi> It being therefore a matter of ſuch moment with God himſelf, to be joynted and joyned to our Foundation, that to all ſuch, life, and eternal Salvation is promiſed, let us be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wary, how raſhly we cut off, either particular Churches, or private Men, from this Conjunction, and by the ſame verdict caſt them from all hope of life and happineſſe.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe beſides theſe Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call words of <hi>Foundation</hi> and <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:54675:42"/>ſometimes other termes are uſed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame force, and intimating alſo the ſame dependancy of the Church on another, of them alſo briefly. What therefore is called the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Church, when it is compared to a Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; when it is likened to a Man, is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Head; when reſembled to a Tree, ſtiled the Root. It is called an Head, becauſe it maintaineth the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers united unto it, ceaſing not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey ſpirituall ſtrength, and life into them. In the ſame ſenſe, it is named a Root, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſpouteth a vitall Sap into all the Boughs and Sprigs ingrafted in it. As therefore thoſe are counted <hi>Fundamental</hi> Doctrines, which are ſufficiently effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, and abſolutely neceſſary to joyne Chriſtians to their <hi>Foundation;</hi> ſo may they alſo be called Capit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                     <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the only Perſonall Foundation of the Church, Christ Jeſus God and Man, Mediator betwixt God and Men, and of the true conjunction with him.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE moſt wiſe God, and moſt loving towards mankind, was pleaſed to found a Church, which ſhould endure for ever, and prevaile againſt the Gates of Hell. Now ſuch a Church could not be, except it ſtood on a ſolid and eternall Foundation, which might not be forced by any ſtrength, or foundred by Engines. God therefore, thought fit to lay no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Foundation than Jeſus Chriſt, the eternall Son, of an eternal Father, whom he <hi>ſent into the World, that every one which beleeveth on him, might not dye, but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54675:44"/>have everlaſting life.</hi> The prophets and Apoſtles witneſſe with a joynt conſent, Him alone to be the Perſonall Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 118.22. Eſay. 28.16. Act. 4.11, 12. 1 Cor. 3.11.</note> Hence <hi>David</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Him the <hi>corner Stone: Eſaiah</hi> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Him <hi>a tryed Stone, Precious, and placed in the foundation of Zion. This is the Stone, ſet at nought by the Builders, which is become the Head of the Corner, neither is there Salvation in any other. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Jeſus Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now what hath been ſaid of this one only <hi>Foundation,</hi> ought alſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the one only Head, Husband, Root of the Church, and alſo of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Metaphorical Titles, which import the ſame dignity of Chriſt, &amp; the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſame dependancy on him. For Chriſt God and man, is the only quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſaving Head of the Church, <hi>from whom the whole Body is fitly joyned together and compacted:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 4.15 16. Ioh. 3.29. Hoſ. 2.20. Fph. 5.26.</note> He is the only Bridegrom of the Church <hi>who hath the Bride,</hi> and hath eſpouſed her to himſelf, that he might Eternally preſerve, that is, that he may ſanctifie her in this World, and preſent her glorious in that which is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54675:44"/>to come. Laſtly, he is the heavenly root of the Church,
<note place="margin">Col. 2.7.</note> in whom whoſoever <hi>are roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> ſpring up towards Heaven and ſhall continually flouriſh in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>This Perſonall prerogative is ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly inveſted in Chriſt God and man, that it can agree to no other.
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.11</note> Not to Angels, becauſe they want that confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Nature, which ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Foundation and things founded in it, the Head and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers joyned unto it, the Husband and Wife coupled to him in lawfull mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Not to a bare man, becauſe no mortall, by reaſon of the corruption and weakneſſe of humane Nature can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly performe the office of a <hi>Foundation,</hi> Head, Spouſe, in upholding, quickening, and preſerving of the Church. Not to God himſelfe conſidered alone in the dreadfull nature of his Divine Majeſtie. For though we acknowledge God the founder of the Church, we ſtill want a Foundation, to which we need not feare to approach, draw neare, to come, and as it were to glue our ſelves. But the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of God conſidered in it ſelfe, is not only <hi>a light not to be approached unto,</hi> but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54675:45"/>alſo <hi>is a conſuming fire, and what mortall man can dwell with a devouring fire?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 12.29. Iſa. 33.14.</note> We cannot therefore have in, or under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, any other perſonall Foundation, by the Mediation whereof, we may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled and united to God, ſave only the Word,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.14.</note> 
                        <hi>Made Man, full of Grace and Truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to what purpoſe is this diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a matter ſo plaine, and granted of all Proteſtants? Namely, that it may hence appeare, that other Churches nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may, nor ought to renounce bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Communion with thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, which retaine a ſaving conjunction with this Foundation. We wonder not that the Papiſts, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Chriſt himſelf make another perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Foundation, another Head, another Husband of the Church, cut and caſt off all Churches, though firmely and faſtly ſticking to Chriſt, which cleave not to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to their Foundation, Head &amp; Husband. Nor care we for their falſe clamours, whereby they think to affright the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If ye be founded upon the Rock of</hi> Rome <hi>ye be living and pretious ſtones, if not, only
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54675:45"/>ſpongy and hollow ones. If ye acknowledge the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>Head of the Churches, ye are the true and living members of the holy Catholique Church; if otherwiſe, ye are dead and rotten carkaſſes of Churches. Lastly if ye imbrace the Pope for your Husband, ye are chaſt and true-borne Churches; if otherwiſe, ye are adulterous and to be accurſed to the pit of Hell,</hi> So the Romaniſts. We can patiently take theſe taunts and wrongs from their hands, who dreame that our Churches are rent from the true Foundation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they refuſe to joyne with a falſe. But verily if any Proteſtant Church, which dares not deny, but that another is built on Chriſt, ſhould dare notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to cut the ſame off, as a rotten member, and caſt it off from all brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Communion; this were to offer an affront to Chriſt himſelfe, and to do an injury to the Brethren, both of us and Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>That therefore we may know, with what Churches it is meet for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Brotherly Communion, we ought to know what Churches are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to have and to hold true and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54675:46"/>Union with this their Foundation; We deny not, but that amongſt the Churches which cleave to this only Foundation, ſome may be faſtened firmer and nearer than others, amongſt the Churches quickened by this Head and Root; ſome may draw more plentifull ſenſe and ſap than others: but we ought not, becauſe of the ſeverall degrees of Knowledge and Grace, to ſeparate our ſelves from Brotherly Communion with thoſe whom we may, and ought to hope, as yet to remaine conjoyned with their ſaving Foundation.</p>
                     <p>As touching ſingle Perſons, God alone who ſearcheth the Heart, can know who have an inward, ſpirituall and lively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with this ſaving Foundation. But concerning whole Churches, (ſo far as it is lawfull for men to know and judge) whether or no they be ſavingly coupled to the Foundation, it may be judged and determined by the works, which can and uſe dayly to be exerciſed by them. For thoſe Churches, wherin thoſe Acts are performed, whereby men may be united to Chriſt, remaine in him, and by him be brought to eternall life,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54675:46"/>none can affirme, or will imagine that ſuch are eſtranged or pluckt aſunder, from this the only Foundation of mans Salvation.</p>
                     <p>That we may now begin from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. In all Reformed Churches, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme is adminiſtred in the Name of the moſt holy Trinity, by benefit wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſuch are grafted into Chriſt, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coupled to this their Foundation. For as for theſe Infants who cannot by any Act of their own, apply themſelves to the Foundation, the holy Spirit vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth by the Laver of Regeneration, to frame, &amp; apply the Foundation to them. But of thoſe who are capable of Reaſon, and can uſe the Freedome of their own will, 'tis expected and required from them, that they bring divers Acts, both of their Underſtanding, and Will to the making and keeping of their due Union with Chriſt. Amongſt which theſe foure are accounted the Principall, to which all others may eaſily bee redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, on the part of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is required an Act of knowing all thoſe things concerning God, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54675:47"/>Chriſt, without which no ſaving Union can be eſtabliſhed betwixt us, and Chriſt, nor free Reconciliation betwixt us, and God the Father. To which purpoſe thoſe words of our Saviour ſeem to tend, <hi>This is eternall Life, that they might know thee the only true God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 17.3.</note> 
                        <hi>and Jeſus Christ whom thou hast ſent.</hi> If there be any Congregations of men, which as yet have not attained to this meaſure of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Knowledge, we confeſſe ſuch to <hi>be alienated from the life of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ephe. 4.18. &amp; 2.12 13.</note> 
                        <hi>through the Ignorance that is in them, and that becauſe of the blindneſſe of their hearts,</hi> as we are taught by the Apoſtle. But there is none of the Proteſtant Churches blinded with ſuch dark Ignorance, but that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians therein may know God and Chriſt ſo far as is ſufficient to Salvation, if they aſſent to the Truth Preached amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, beſides this ſpeculative Knowledge of God and Chriſt, there is alſo required an Act of beleeving, that is, Practically with Aſſurance to rely on Chriſt being knowne. We grant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that thoſe Churches, or Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of men, met in one body of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54675:47"/>however they may put on, and pretend the Name of Chriſtian, yet to have no entercourſe, nor ſociety with Chriſt the Foundation, amongſt whom, Chriſt is not ſo preached, nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that men may rely on him with a lively and juſtifying Faith. Such are thoſe, which diſſolve the Hypoſtaticall Union of two Natures in Chriſt the Mediatour, without which we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have nor hope for a ſaving conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with Chriſt, and God the Father. But in all the Reformed Churches, Chriſt, God and Man, is ſo Preached, that there is no doubt to be made, but number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſoules embrace him, with a true, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and juſtifying Faith. They are therfore, and do remaine conjoyned to this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, under that very formall conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, wherein Chriſt the Foundation of mans Salvation may bee conjoyned to men, to conferre Grace, and Life up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, on the part of the Will, it is required of all that would not be parted from this their Foundation, that they practiſe a dayly exerciſe of Repentance, without which it muſt needes come to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54675:48"/>paſſe that our dayly ſins muſt divide, and ſeparate us from God and Chriſt, to our eternall deſtruction. On the other ſide, where this conſtant practice of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance comes betwixt, we remaine foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Chriſt, reconciled to God, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to happineſſe. Wherefore in what Church ſoever the Goſpell is ſo preached, and the Foundation of mans Salvation is ſo ſetled and eſtabliſhed, that it is to be hoped that Chriſtians taught by it, and living in it, by beleeving, and repenting, may obtaine forgiveneſſe of their ſins and everlaſting life: we ought to pronounce, and conceive of that Church, that it is truly conjoyned, and remaines firmly coupled to Chriſt, the Author, Fountaine, and Foundation of Grace and Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, beſides this Practice of Repentance, that this our conjunction with the foundation may be the more ſure and evident, the unfeigned deſire, and endeavour of Obedience, and a new Life, flowing from Faith and Love of Chriſt, is required. If the Act of Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be wanting, there wants the Act of Beleeving, and Loving, there wants all
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54675:48"/>hope of conjoyning ſuch with Chriſt. For what Chriſt ſaid,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.15</note> 
                        <hi>If you love mee keep my Commandements,</hi> was all one as if he had ſaid, If you be conjoyned to me, keep my Commandements:
<note place="margin">Gal. 6.15. and 5.6.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>In Chriſt neither Circumciſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion, but Faith which worketh by Love.</hi> What Churches then ſoever of the Proteſtants ſtand in this condition, that men in them are enlightned to know God, and Chriſt, are furthered to beleeve in him, are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away from their ſins by the Act of Repentance, are made ſubject to God and his Commandements, by the act of Loving and Obeying him: No doubt is to be made, but that theſe Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine firmely faſtned to their ſaving Foundation. Therefore this ſaving and undoubted Union of them with Chriſt, ought to bring a Tye and a Band of no meane Conſequence, to the binding of the Affections of all Reformed Churches together.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>ALTHOUGH We acknowledge our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, the only perſonall Foundation of his Church, yet do we not deny, but that the name Foundation, is in a different ſenſe aſcribed to others. To whom, in what reſpect, this high Title is given, and what Power and Command they have, who are thus intitled, it muſt be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards enquired into.</p>
                     <p>The name therefore of Foundation is ſometimes lent to others, but then always in a leſſened and reſtrained acception. For they are called Foundations in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther right, than becauſe the perſonall Foundation is layd by their Miniſtery, through the preaching of the Goſpell, and by the continuation of that preaching always kept in the Church.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt theſe Miniſteriall Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Prophets and Apoſtles poſſeſſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54675:49"/>the prime place. Hence the wall of the Heavenly Jeruſalem is ſaid to have <hi>twelve Foundations,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 21.14.</note> 
                        <hi>and in them the names of the twelve Apoſtles of the Lambe.</hi> Alſo Chriſtians are ſaid to <hi>be built upon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 2.20.</note> In this ſenſe <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and all the Apoſtles were Miniſteriall Foundations, becauſe all they as wiſe Maſter-builders beſtowed their excellent paines in laying that only Foundation, of which we ſpake before. Wherefore when the Prophets, and Apoſtles are adorned with this hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Title, it is rather to be referred to their ſaving Doctrin concerning Chriſt, than to their own particular Perſons. The power of theſe was far greater than that of their ſucceeding Miniſters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſo enlightned, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the holy Spirit, that they could not at all erre, either in Preaching, or Writing. Therefore we acknowledge their Doctrine, as the Doctrine of God and Chriſt, certaine, infallible, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Divine, with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that ſaith, <hi>There is no Divine Word but of God alone.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In that his booke of the Soule.</note> 
                        <hi>Which Word was thundred both by the Prophets, by the Apoſtles, by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:54675:50"/>
                     <p>But the Papiſts to theſe Miniſteriall Foundations, endeavour to joyne ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in words calling it a Second, and ſubſervient, but in very deed making it a Principall, and plainly Divine one. This honour the Jeſuites thinke fit to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on the Pope alone, whom they ſo appoint to be the Second Foundation of the Catholike Church, that in the meane time they maintaine him to be the only Foundation of the Church next unto Chriſt. But there is no need to ſpeake much of this fading foundation, and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy-ſhaking head; the Scriptures being ſilent of any ſuch ſole Miniſteriall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, as the Papiſts do faine. Beſides all Proteſtant Churches long ſince have caſt this filthy Idoll of a ſecondary head and foundation with others of the like nature to the Moles and Bats, as fit for ſo blind companions. We owne no power placed in this ſecondary founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Papiſts, to ſubject the Faith of Chriſtians unto it, counting thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better than mad, when they write and maintaine,

                        <hi>That the power and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Pope of Rome, is the ſumme of Christian Religion, and his judgment is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54675:50"/>to bee accounted the ſquare and Rule of Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But leaving the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> lets come to the Catholique Church, which on a farre better title might challenge to her ſelfe the name of Miniſteriall Foundation, becauſe the Faith of every one may ſeeme in ſome ſort to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her. For in this even to the end of the World that Doctrine ſhall bee kept and preached, to which thoſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans which afford beliefe and obedience, are rightly joyned to their foundation, and in it ſhall obtaine eternall Life. To this purpoſe that of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> is often alleadged, where he calleth the Church, the <hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3 15.</note> Neither may we doubt, but that in this Holy Catholique Church, (which wee beleeve in the Creed) the truth of the Goſpell ever hath and ever will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſo farre forth, as it ſhall ſuffice for the Salvation of thoſe that beleeve it. Therefore to know what hath been beleeved, received, and publiſhed of all Chriſtian Churches, always and every where, is to know all thoſe things which are ſufficient for the obtaining
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54675:51"/>of Salvation in Chriſt, the Foundation thereof. But this Catholique Church ſcattered over all the world, is preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, rather to our mind, than outward ſenſes. Wherefore when we deſire to heare the voyce of the Catholique Church, wee are forced to fly to the Church, which they call Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; that is to ſay, to a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. Of which Repreſentative Image of the Catholique Church, and of the Miniſteriall power therof we will brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>That this Repreſentative Church did excellently diſcharge the Office of a Miniſteriall Foundation in Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Synods, is witneſſed by thoſe foure Councils of <hi>Nice, Conſtantinople, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> In which the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt, againſt <hi>Arius,</hi> of the holy Ghoſt, againſt <hi>Macedonius,</hi> the Union of two Natures in Chriſt, againſt <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> the diſtinction of two Natures, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Eutyches,</hi> were declared, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and eſtabliſhed. In theſe and the like Councils, thoſe Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith, which were there in common handled and diſcuſſed, becauſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54675:51"/>therein all that profeſſed Chriſtianity, were repreſented, are therefore with great reverence to bee received. For it ever belongeth to the Office and lawfull power of this Repreſentative Church, to divide and diſtinguiſh Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith, from thoſe which were not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, provided alwayes that they paſſed not the bounds ſet by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Primitive Church, to multiply or diminiſh the Number of theſe Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals.
<note place="margin">2a. 2ae <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. <hi>Art.</hi> 7. <hi>Reſp. ad</hi> 4.</note> For it is credible (what <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> obſerved) that the Apoſtles and others which were nearer to Chriſt, had a fuller Knowledge of the myſteries of the Faith, than we that are further off, which <hi>Cajetan</hi> in the ſame place confeſſeth to be moſt true. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that the Apoſtles, and the Fathers of the Primitive Church, were not much given to controverſall Divinity, and diſputing about Queſtions, yet were they of all moſt skilfull, in ſaving, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and Fundamentall Divinity.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, after this Repreſentative Church had once publiſhed her reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion founded in Gods Word, of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54675:52"/>Articles, which were ſimply neceſſary to the Salvation of Chriſtians, the care and charge alſo lay upon her to defend, fence and fortifie thoſe Articles, againſt all fraud, and force of Heretiques. For it is the wont of Heretiques, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine the very Foundation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, whilſt they retaine the words, but deny the matter of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. Thus the <hi>Arians,</hi> in words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſt to be the Son of God, but they hatcht a Monſter in their hearts, when they would not acknowledge him to be coeſſentiall to the Father.

                     <p>It was lawfull therefore for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative Church (that is for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell) for the better declaring of the true meaning of an Article, to frame and fit a new (but apt) terme, and to compell Chriſtians to confeſſe Chriſts Divinity under this forme of words, <hi>Christ is Coeſſentiall with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                     <p>Laſtly, we do not ſtraiten and confine the power of an Oecumenicall Synod, or repreſentative Church, only to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring and defending of Fundamentall Articles, ſuch whereof an explicite and cleare unfolded Faith muſt be had to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but wee confeſſe the ſame alſo doth extend to any true doctrines, and profitable for the edification of mens Soules.

                     <p>If therefore the name of Miniſteriall Foundation doth agree to the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Church, or Generall Councill; for the Miniſteriall power it hath in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing, explaining, and defending that Doctrine which joyneth Chriſtians to their ſaving foundation, it agreeth alſo in its kind, and degree to every particular Church, ſuppoſe the <hi>Engliſh, French, Dutch,</hi> and others, which take their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination

                     <p>From this Office, the Church of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> wherof <hi>Timothy</hi> was Preſident, is called <hi>the pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the duty of every Church to defend and maintaine the Truth (prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the Apoſtles to the World) commending, and explaining the ſame to the people, and to unſheath, and draw the Sword of Eccleſiaſticall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures againſt forgers and Heretiques.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, we muſt obſerve, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches (for inſtance, thoſe of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Switzerland</hi>) may and ought to commend the Summe of the Doctrin of the Goſpell, which they profeſſe, to ſuch as are ſubject to their Miniſtery,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54675:54"/>which abridgement of Doctrine, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled and digeſted into Articles, we uſe to call the Confeſſion of the Churches, or Articles of Religion. But a ſpeciall care muſt be had, that in the framing of theſe Articles, we inſert not into them, any thing that is ſubtile, ſuperfluous, and litigious. For it is not the part of wiſe Doctors, to ſtuffe thoſe things, which ſhould further Peace, and the Edification of Soules, with that which may trouble the Learned, help the Unlearned little or nothing to Salvation. For what is this elſe, than to miniſter to the Learned matter of ſtriffe, and to thruſt on the unlearned, Wind for Milk, and Stones for Bread.</p>
                     <p>We ought alſo to have ſome reſpect of neighbouring Churches, in theſe our Confeſſions, which wee ſet forth, and nor to affect in our Articles, to expoſe to the view of all that, whence occaſion of wrangling may bee given to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Proteſtant Churches, and matter of rejoycing afforded to the Papiſts. Theſe inconveniencies might eaſily bee avoyded, if it would once enter into the hearts of Divines, to ſever hard and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure

                     <p>Laſtly, when theſe Confeſſions are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in this manner, it is lawfull and uſefull for every particular Church, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe that Juriſdiction over their owne people, which in no caſe, they ought or can uſurpe over the ſubjects of another Church. For if their own oppoſe the received Doctrine of their Church, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by publique conſent, they may (both for the errors they ſcatter, and for the diſturbance they cauſe in the Church) put them aſide from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of their Church, ſo long till they leave off to infect others, and trouble the Church with their errours.

                     <p>Laſt of all, I may adde this concerning private Doctors. It is a moſt in jurious thing, that a whole Church ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited guilty of the errors of that Doctor, whatſoever hee bee, which hath or doth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54675:56"/>uſe his Miniſtery therein, unleſſe it doth appeare, that that Church by their publique aſſent doth approve and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his errors. But where is there one of an hundred amongſt common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who ſo ſearches the books of their Doctors, that he giveth his conſent to all their Opinions?

                     </head>
                     <p>THE Doctrine of the Holy Scripture contained in the Books of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles, is that Foundation, on which alone the Faith of Chriſtians may ſafely rely, becauſe of the moſt certaine authority of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing it. Nor muſt we give eare to the Papiſts when they object:

                        <hi>Whence know you thoſe Books to have been given to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by the Spirit of the moſt true God? If God as yet hath not perſwaded me in this point, he hath not as yet perſwaded me that I am a Christian: For the will of God hath commended the Scriptures unto us, to be the Foundation and Pillar of our Faith.</hi> If the Romaniſts will give no credence, neither to <hi>Auguſtine</hi> nor <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> they ought notwithſtanding undoubtedly to beleeve <hi>Peter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19 20, 21.</note> who calleth the voyce of the Scriptures, <hi>a voyee more ſure than that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54675:57"/>which came down from Heaven, and not brought by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake it, as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Therefore the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſo propoundeth the foundations of our Faith, and faſtens the Rule of our Doctrine, that the Faith of Chriſtians only truſteth and repoſeth it ſelfe on thoſe Revelations, which are contained in the canonicall Books. I will ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt that fantaſtick imaginary Doctrinall foundation, which the Papiſts triſlingly defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, to be in a word not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and couched in the privy cabinet of the Popes breaſt, becauſe I conceive ſo profane and groſſe an error, in a matter of ſo great moment, amongſt wel inſtructed Chriſtians is not worthy of a confutation. He that ſeeks for the Doctrine of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Eternall Life out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, ſhall find it no ſooner than if hee looked for the Tree of Knowledge and Life out of Paradiſe.</p>
                     <p>But although wee ſtraitly maintain that no fundamentall Doctrine of Faith, is to bee ſought for out of the Bookes of the Old and New Teſtament; yet wee do not defend that all things contained
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54675:58"/>in theſe books are fundamentall points, ſo neceſſary to be known and beleeved, that if any of theſe be unknown, or denyed of any, we ſhould preſently adjudge them to have falne off from the foundation of Salvation. Many things in the Books of both Teſtaments are Hiſtoricall, ſome things are dogmaticall, which are truly affirmed, and profitably placed there, and yet are accounted not to come into the Number of Fundamentall points. Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſſe things there are, which by true &amp; firme conſequence may be deduced out of the Scriptures, and yet mount not up to this high pitch of honour. Therefore thoſe things only are to be ſet apart, and owned for Fundamentals, without the plaine, and explicite Knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, none can be ſaved; &amp; in which, as well Negative infidelity, not at all to know them, as poſitive infidelity, to refuſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them doth condemn. Now ſuch are all thoſe things without w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſavingly beleeve in Chriſt, nor right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call upon God in Chriſt, and worſhip him to the obtaining of eternall Life; In a word, without which Chriſtians can neither have pious affections towards God, nor exerciſe the Religious Acts of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54675:58"/>Faith, Hope, and Charity, being abſolutly neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two things beene yeelded, and granted, that our Faith is to truſt on the Scriptures alone, and that all, &amp; every one of thoſe things which may be ſeen in the large proſpect of the Scriptures, are not to bee ranked with Fundamentals; this is to be added in the third place, that our Faith is ſo ſubject, and tyed to the whole word of God, that every one is bound to embrace every Truth which hee ſees re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the holy Scriptures, or duly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from them. For although, out of the nature or matter of a Propoſition we are not bound and obliged to beleeve, and know it, under the perill of loſſe of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Life: Yet notwithſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the authority of the revealer, ſo oft as it ſhall appeare unto us, that ſuch a propoſition is revealed in Scripture, we are bound not to refuſe it. For whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhould pretend on the contrary, who at his pleaſure ſhall trample on a propoſition which he underſtands to bee founded on the Scripture; he is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted one that gives not that beleefe which he ought to any propoſition. For
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54675:59"/>Inſtance ſake: That Chriſt is God and Man, is a plaine Fundamentall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, which if not at all beleeved, we can neither beleeve in Chriſt himſelfe, nor ſo worſhip God, as to be reſtored into his favour, and admitted into his Kingdom: But many things are expreſly mentioned in Scripture of this Chriſt himſelfe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnated, which are not Fundamentall; alſo many things may bee deduced from this Fundamentall Article, <hi>Chriſt is God and Man,</hi> which are not to be reckoned as Fundamentals. If notwithſtanding they be perceived, and underſtood to bee placed in, or duly deduced from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, hee contemnes God ſpeaking in the Scriptures, who beleeves not ſuch Propoſitions. But as often as it ſhall happen, not out of the perverſneſſe of the Will, but weakneſſe of the Judgement, that he, being deceived with an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<note place="margin">

                        </note> that Truth and Piety are on his ſide, ſhall affirme or deny any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Scriptures, even in thoſe his Tenets, which thorough his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance are not Catholique, his heart and mind notwithſtanding is Catholique, becauſe it is prepared for amendment on
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54675:59"/>better information. Of ſuch therefore we may rightly ſay,
<note place="margin">Heb. 5.14 Rom. 14.1</note> that they have their Senſes not ſo well exerciſed in heavenly matters, that they are weak and children in Faith, that they are not to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with us to doubtfull Diſputes, but we cannot truly call them, forraigners e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged from Chriſt, Apoſtates from the Faith, &amp; ſuch as are to be ſeparated from Brotherly Communion with the Godly.</p>
                     <p>However therefore let it be taken for granted, that the Romiſh Prelats do not deny any Fundamentall point, truly and properly ſo called: hence notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it appeares, that they both hurt the Unity of the Catholique Faith, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Union of the Catholike Church. For what Church ſoever, ſhall patch their own uncertain opinions to the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Articles of the Chriſtian Faith muſt needs miſhape and deforme the body of the Catholique Faith, by joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to it ſo many members, both uſeles and monſtruous. But as for thoſe which uſe the ſame, and inforce them on other Churches to be beleeved, under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Salvation, it manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that they alone are guilty of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54675:60"/>rents in the Catholique Church. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the pride of the Romiſh Church, ſwels ſo big, that it leaves no room to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Truth: but I hope that all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches, will at length conſent in this, to renew the Brotherly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion betwixt them, and not to thruſt their private opinions on others. That attempt of the Papiſts, to ſhut out all from the Catholique Church, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Salvation, which in all things give not their aſſent to the Creed of <hi>Trent,</hi> ever ſeemed to me ſo deſperate and foule, that all the water of the Ocean powred upon <hi>Rome,</hi> can not waſh away the ſtaintherof.</p>
                     <p>Wee deſire that all which wee have ſpoken be underſtood, of caſting them off from Brotherly Communion, who either out of obſtinacy or ignorance, contradict the Scriptures, in any Principle of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Faith, which not at all being known, we can neither have Union with Chriſt, nor Adoption by him into the Son of God; which, not at all being beleeved, we can neither rightly perform Gods worſhip, nor from him obtaine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Salvation. Such things are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denied, nor unknown of any, which

                     <p>Moreover, neither are the things which we have ſaid ſo to be taken, as if thereby leave and liberty were given to Chriſtian people, to ſet up their reſt in fundamentals, and to go no further in ſearching the Scriptures, as if it were lawfull to ſleight any Doctrine, which we confeſſe not to be fundamentall.

                     <p>Now as concerning forreigne Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, I deny not, but that other Churches may, and ought to confute their errors, although they contradict not the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Chriſtian Faith.

                     <p>WEE have ſhowne already that Fundamentall points have this character plainly printed upon them, that without the knowledge of them, neither Salvation of Chriſtians, nor the Worſhip of God can conſiſt. Now let us adde ſome other ſignes and tokens, out of which we may ſafely ſet down, that any point is not Fundamentall, although ſome urge, and enforce it for Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, and they eſpecially, who have long laboured, and ſweat ſoundly in the maintaining of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, that is not Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, which was never clearely revealed from the beginning, by the Prophets, and Apoſtles inſpired from Heaven, to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people, and to Chriſtian Churches, founded by them through the whole World.

                     <p>Secondly, that is no Fundamentall Point, which was never admitted and held for ſuch in the Primitive Church, ſucceeding the Apoſtles, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recommended to all, by generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Catholique Church. For if any will maintaine, that the Catholique Church did ever refuſe, or was ignorant

It was well obſerved by the right Reverend Arch-biſhop of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> a man of ſingular Piety, and ſtored with the commendation for Learning in all kinds. <hi>That if at this day, wee ſhould put by the points, wherein Chriſtians dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer one from another, and gather into one body the reſt of the Articles wherein they generally agree:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vſher Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, pag. 43.</note> (which worſhip Chriſt God and Man, and acknowledge him for their Saviour) <hi>We ſhould find that in thoſe propoſitions, which without all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally received in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, ſo much truth is contained, as being joyned with holy Obedience, may be ſufficient to bring a man unto everlasting, Salvation.</hi> Which plainely evinceth that theſe things alone of the common Faith, are thoſe, which rightly are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Fundamentall: but as for thoſe points, which we ſo dearely priſe, and for love of them claſh the Proteſtant Churches together, becauſe of the right
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54675:64"/>of neare alliance which they have with the Fundamentals, they may ſometimes be ranked amongſt true and profitable Doctrines, but may not be accounted ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, or Fundamentall.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is not a Fundamentall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime of the Chriſtian Religion, which is ſo handled or propounded, that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the truth thereof, and to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it with Faith, we ſtand in need of the Wit, and cunning of Logicians, and of the abſtracted and abſtruſe ſpeculation of Metaphyſitians.

Yea, every one of the plaine countrey People is more fit than thy ſelfe, and thou altogether unfit, if thou thinkeſt that in theſe things, thou mayſt rely on thy own Art, and witty apprehenſion, for the way of Salvation is not only <hi>a holy way,</hi> but alſo <hi>ſo plaine and direct, that the fooliſh cannot wander in it:</hi>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54675:65"/>of the holy Scriptures, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving whereof, there is more need and uſe of Faith, than Art; of an obedient Heart, than of a ſubtile and piercing Wit.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, as all points juſtly challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to themſelves the Title of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, are plaine and naked, for the manner of their Expreſſion; ſo ought they to be few, and ſo framed, that they do not ſwell to an infinite number, yea, that they grow not into ſo great a bulk, burthenſome to bee portable in the memory of Gods little ones.

Let it ſatisfie thee that thou haſt the Foundation, and let alone to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers to build thereupon.</hi> Would to God only Artificers would build upon them; would to God they would not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54675:66"/>mingle their many, and almoſt infinite ſuperſtructures, with the few, and plaine Fundamentals, to bee embraced with equall affections, and to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with honour alike. If they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour thus to do; yet it becomes all pious and prudent Chriſtians to diſcerne and make a difference betwixt thoſe firſt, and few things to bee beleeved, immediately revealed by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and thoſe numberleſſe deductions of Divines, which they, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeverall minds and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, ſeeke to thruſt, and crowd into the ſame roome with Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, it is no Fundamentall point, which though furbiſhed and attired in new termes, is not the ſame in effect, with the Doctrine expreſſed in the words of the Holy Scripture. For if the addition of our new coyned words, importeth any thing more than what is in the Scripture, this new acceſſion may bee allowed for a conſequent of the Fundamentall Doctrine, but it cannot with this new peece bee urged for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, downeright Fundamentall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54675:66"/>But if the new word, or the addition therein, for matter of the Senſe of the Propoſition, brings no new thing at all, but ſo that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Termes, the effect of both appeares to be the ſame, then wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge both to bee Fundamentall. For the diſſerence of the expreſſion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not the nature of a Fundamentall Doctrine, where the eſſence and meaning of the Propoſition, remaines the ſame. What wee have ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what obſcurely, we will make plaine by an example.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt is God, and the Sonne of God.</p>
                     <p>This is a Fundamentall Point, and ſo alſo is this,</p>
                     <p>Chriſt is coeſſentiall with God, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Father.</p>
                     <p>For although in the latter, there is a new Terme, yet it addes no new thing, nor affirmes any thing, which will cauſe the cumberance of a toileſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, to extract it out of the former; but whoſoever underſtandeth the termes of both, preſently underſtands, that they agree ſo well, as in ſenſe they are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54675:67"/>the ſame. For no man of ſound ſenſe can have a conceit of diverſe Gods in the ſame Eſſence, or ſubſtance. But if the Doctrine or Propoſition, deck't in forraign Termes and new language, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee annexed to a plaine and cleare Fundamentall Article, without a buſie and artificiall deducing of it, it ought not to bee inſerted into the Catalogue of Fundamentals. Indeed thoſe which perceive the force of the Conſequence, or Deduction, are bound to afford beliefe to ſuch Conſectaries. But they, to whom it doth not ſufficiently appeare, that ſuch a Propoſition followeth from any Fundamentall point, they are not bound to embrace it for a tried Truth, much leſſe for ſuch a Doctrine, without which no hope is left to obtaine Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To conclude in a word, As of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as it is inquired, whether any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine bee Fundamentall or no; let us not give heed to the clamours of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputants, But have recourſe to thoſe Notes, which now wee have reckoned up. If the Doctrines they preſſe on us, bee not clearely recommended by the Apoſtles themſelves to the Catholique
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54675:67"/>Church, in the firſt preaching of the Goſpell, if in ſucceeding Ages they were not Univerſally received, if they bee not ſuited to the capacity of ſimple Chriſtians, but only fitted to the braines of Philoſophers, and Logicians, if they bee too many, and not compriſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in certaine bounds: Laſtly, if expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſuch formes of Speech, that they cannot bee reduced to an equivalent ſenſe, with a cleare and of all confeſſed Fundamentall Article, ſometimes they may bee Truthes, but they can never be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>MANY of the Papiſts, and ſomme of ours, when we maintaine that the difference betwixt the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, is not about Fundamentals, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require of us, to bring in a Bill, and ſet forth an acurate Catalogue of Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals; ſo that we may ſay, ſo many Fundamentals there be of the Chriſtian Faith, neither more nor leſſe. We eaſily anſwer the Papiſts, that it were preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in Proteſtants, who confeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſubject to errour, to undertake ſo hard a Taske: let Papiſts rather addreſſe themſelves to the Pope of Rome, who alone can ſpeake Oracles, and is ſaid to have all Laws, Humane and Divine, lockt up in the Cloſet of his Breſt.</p>

Yet are there ſome moſt learned and famous Divines, which terme all Propoſitions Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which they themſelves by good, and ſtrong Conſequence, inferre out of the former Fundamentals, although few or none bee found in their neighbouring Churches, who plainely perceive the Truth of theſe Conſequences. Many things deterre me from being of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, but this moſt eſpecially, that this would bee a neceſſary and everlaſting cauſe, of an unneceſſary and everlaſting Rent betwixt the Churches of Chriſt. Laſtly, there never were, nor will bee wanting ſome, who will require that it may bee reckoned amongſt the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, whatſoever themſelves unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly and erroneouſly dreame, that they have digged and drawn out of the Word of God. And theſe for the moſt part are thoſe hatefull and troubleſome Brawlers, who preſently give out the Alarum, that the Foundations of Religion are pluckt up from the very roots, if any dare ſhake their imaginary Fundamentals. Whilſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54675:69"/>the very nature and definition of a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Doctrine flotes in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is no more impoſſible to count the waves of the Sea, than it is perciſely to define the ſet, and certaine number of Fundamentall Doctrines, ebbing and flowing according to mens ſeverall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                     <p>But leaſt I might ſeeme wholly to wave and decline the marking out of Fundamentall Doctrines, I will ſhew plainely what was the opinion both of Ancient and Moderne Divines in this matter, by publique producing of their teſtimonies.</p>
                     <p>As touching things to be beleeved, all Foundations of the Chriſtian Faith, are compriſed in the Apoſtles Creed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall he, who from his heart profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that he affordeth beliefe to all, and every thing therein contained, be defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in any thing (ſo farre as concernes things to be beleeved) to the partaking of Salvation in Chriſt, and retaining of Communion with the brethren of Chriſt.

                     </p>
                     <p>Out of which teſtimonies we gather, that it was the generall opinion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, that all Fundamentall Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith, neceſſary with the neceſſity of the meanes to the Salvation of men, were comprehended in the Creed, ſo that none ſhall periſh, for meer ignorance of God and Chriſt, who give an explicite Faith to theſe things.

                     <p>Now as we have ſet downe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed, for the briefe of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals pertaining to the ſaving Myſteries of Faith, ſo wee acknowledge the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue as the Symbole and Summe of all things to be done, as touching duties due to the worſhip of God, and offices of Charity which wee owe to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. For wee may fitly enough call Fundamentall Doctrines, not only thoſe Myſteries of Faith, whoſe explained Knowledge is altogether neceſſary to the Salvation of Chriſtians: but alſo thoſe Doctates of the Divine Law, which if we know not at all, we cannot wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54675:73"/>God as we ought to the obtaining of Salvation. In this ſenſe we terme the Decalogue the Summe of things to bee done, even as wee ſtyled the other (of which we have ſpoken before) the Sum of things to be beleeved. For the meere ſpeculative Knowledge of the Divine Myſteries, without the practicall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Divine Mandats, can bring none to bleſſedneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Therefore,

For to this Law not only our corporall life, but alſo our ſpirituall life ought to bee ſubjected. Now thoſe things which are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this Law of God are ſo fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, that they cannot be broken without the guilt of death, nor oppoſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed without the ſtaine of Hereſie.</p>
                     <p>The Fundamentals of the Creed aime at this end, that we may know God and Chriſt to eternall Life, as either hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed himſelfe: The Fundamentals of the Decalogue drive at this; That wee may worſhip both as they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded themſelves to be worſhipped.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54675:73"/>If any overthrow the Fundamentals of Gods worſhip, he is ſhut out from Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as much as if hee had overturned the Myſteries of Faith. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived,</hi>

                        <hi>neither fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers,</hi> &amp;c. As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, It is no leſſe damnable to erre in theſe morall, than in ſpeculative principles. For the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of ones opinion, about thoſe things which pertaine to manners, may make an Heretique, no leſſe than about thoſe things which pertaine to Faith, if it be in any Univerſall Principle of Gods Law. Hee that beleeves he may worſhip many Gods, or adore the true God in an Image made with hands, that is of the opinion that theft or fornication are things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, grates upon a Fundamentall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and runs into a deadly, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Hereſie. For the practicall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate, which is included in every man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date of the Law is a Fundamentall truth, and ought equally to bee beleeved as an Article of the Creed, in ſpeculative things. If any man therefore ſhould beleeve, or teach that our Parents are
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54675:74"/>not to be honoured, or any thing elſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Commandement of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he reverenceth his Parents with due honour, or keepes that Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement himſelfe, yet ſhould hee bee an Hetetique, and juſtly to bee accuſed for overturning a Foundation of Faith. Let the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> therefore looke to it, which boaſteth that the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Chriſtian Faith hitherto have been preſerved chiefly by her care, whether or no ſhe hath not groſly, and damnably erred in the Fundamentals of the Decalogue; to ſay nothing of her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther errors.</p>
                     <p>Now if any will adde unto the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Doctrines of the Creed and Commandements, the Doctrine alſo of the Sacraments clearely revealed in the Goſpell, I am not againſt it: provided on this condition, that as they ſhall not all paſſe for fundamentals, which Divines endeavour to build upon the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Articles of the Creed, but that thoſe only bee counted fundamentall, which are neceſſary for all to know and beleeve to Salvation: So alſo in the matter of the Sacraments, every thing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54675:74"/>ſhall not preſently bee a Fundamentall, which may bee diſputed about the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, or gathered by the occaſion of the Words which Chriſt ſpake; but whatſoever Chriſt hath ſo ſet down, and eſtabliſhed, that it is abſolutely neceſſary to the receiving of Grace and Salvation in the uſe of the Sacraments. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sacrament of Baptiſme, it is a Fundamentall Doctrine, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans muſt be Baptized in the Name of the moſt Holy Trinity, that they may bee grafted into Chriſt. Now they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and doe this, retaine the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall doctrine of Baptiſme, although it may happen that the ſame men may in their minds conceive ſome falſe opinions of Baptiſme, or mingle ſome vaine and uſeleſſe rites in the Adminiſtration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. So in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, this is a Fundamentall Doctrine, That it muſt bee celebrated in bread and wine; that therein the memory of Chriſts Paſſion is ever to be renewed; that Chriſtians in that Sacrament have not only an empty,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.6.</note> or ſhadowy repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of Chriſt crucified, but do truly, really, and ſavingly partake of the body of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54675:75"/>Chriſt. Hee that beleeves all things ſoundly, and ſufficiently, embraceth the Fundamentall Doctrine of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the ſucking of Grace out of it; Although thoſe difficult queſtions toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and tumbled betwixt Divines, about the manner of the Preſence and eating of Chriſt, never came into his head, much leſſe did he give his conſent to one ſide, or other.</p>
                     <p>To this threefold kind of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; Whereof the firſt is ſeen in the Creed: The ſecond, in the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: The third, in the Sacraments of Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper: We may adde a fourth, contained in the Lords Prayer. For ſeeing, invocation or Prayer is a duty belonging to the worſhip of God, abſolutely neceſſary for the obtaining of Grace, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it muſt needs have certaine funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, which being unknowne, or ſlighted, it becomes of no moment, but is effectuall if they be retained and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. This is a fundamentall point: God alone is to be invoked by Religious Prayer, he is to be called upon through his Son our Mediator, truſting on whom
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54675:75"/>we call him <hi>Our Father:</hi> He is to bee Prayed unto for all good things wee want; but chiefly for Grace, Pardon, and Glory, which we moſt ſtand in need of. Laſtly, he is to bee prayed unto in Faith, Charity, and a good Conſcience. He that contradicts theſe things is a ſlat Heretique, and perverts the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals in the duty of Prayer.</p>
                     <p>That theſe foure things, which wee have touched are alone to be accounted Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeemes to me plainly to appeare out of the practice of the Apoſtles themſelvs and Primitive Church, well known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all. For they have judged no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church to have caſt away the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall points of ſaving Faith, or to have fallen off from the Communion of the Catholique Church, who holily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the faith in the Creed, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Commandements, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred the Sacraments according to Chriſts Inſtitution, and called upon God in the Name of Chriſt. For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them to deſerve an admonition for their errors of lighter moment, but would therefore cut off no particular

For it was never heard ſpoken, that one Church brought backe another into the way of truth, or joyned it cloſer to Chriſt by raylings, revilings, curſings, and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Brotherly Communion. The counſels muſt be more mild, and plaiſters more lenitive, which muſt be applied to the healing of an erroneous, and ſetling of a ſhaken Church. As for theſe intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and decrees of ſeparation and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off Communion, they have not only hither to been vaine and uſeleſſe, but alſo miſchievous, and much more forcible to the diſturbing, than building up of the Churches.

The truth of the Antecedent ſeems therefore plaine to me, becauſe all juſt and lawfull ſeperation of every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from its body Catholique, ought to leane, and rely on the authority of the Catholique Church: for one member hath not this judiciary power over another. It is a known Rule of Lawyers, <hi>A ſentence given by him that is not his Judge, is voyd in Law:</hi> But par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches are not the Judges of private perſons living in forreign chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; how much leſſe then over the Churches themſelves? If therefore any Church ſhould pronounce another to be disjoynted from the Communion with the Catholique, Her ſentence were to be ſleighted, and contemned, as of a Judge that preſumed to make laws out of the bounds of his owne Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54675:83"/>But perchance, they who ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily grant the Antecedent of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, will yet doubt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, and ſet downe, that one part of the Catholique Church may caſt off another part thereof (that is, one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, may ſeparate another particular Church) from Brotherly Communion with her ſelfe, by the power of her own private ſentence and authority. I deny, that any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, hath any lawfull power to diſſolve Chriſtian Brotherhood with any other, except ſo farre forth as the ſeparation rely on the Authority of the Catholique Church, which one claſpes and containes within her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces the Churches of all Nations. Now this ſeparation relyes on this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſo often as it is made for thoſe points which are ſo eſtabliſhed by the judgement of the Catholique Church, that they are to bee counted ſhut out from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of faithfull Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who are known to oppoſe or deny them. Truſting on this authority, we juſtly deny brotherly Communion to thoſe Churches, which falſely, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54675:83"/>equivocally are entitled with the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who with joy and jeering, hiſſe out the Divinity of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> Who carpe at the myſtery of the Trinity, which is to be adored, or with ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious boldneſſe overthrow any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Chriſtian Faith; For all theſe things have been paſſed for things judged on, and that by the well known and famous authority of the Apoſtolike and Catholike Church. But this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is not made rightly, nor accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome of the Catholike Church, as often as one particular Church, ſhall deny Brotherly Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to another, for diſſenting from them in queſtions newly riſen, and never determined on one ſide or other, by the authority of the Catholike Church, as points of the Catholike Faith. For no Church can at its own pleaſure breake off the Band of Brotherly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, by which all the members of the Catholike Church are coupled together, with any particular Church, but that with the ſelfe ſame Deed, ſhee divides her ſelfe from the body of the Catholike Church, in which thoſe

Indeed Excommunication, properly ſo called, is the act of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Judge, which paſſeth and layeth hold on thoſe, which are ſubject unto him, and bindeth them, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own wils: But this renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of brotherly communion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſpeake, is an act of one judging only of perſons, not at all ſubject unto him, and declaring them unworthy of all brotherly Communion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore driving, and repelling them from the ſame, although they deſire it. By what name ſo ever any pleaſe to call, this repulſe of other Churches from brotherly communion, it doth them

                     <p>But in this place, it will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable to adviſe in a few words, that the actuall exerciſe of outward Communion with ſome particular Church (conceive the Roman) may be hindered and broken off, and yet by no default of ours; as often as it ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and require that we ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, or exerciſe any Idolatrous Acts in the publike ſervice of God, or ſhould

In the third Articles of the Union of the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> in the tenth Article of the preſence of the Body and Bloud of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Lords Supper, they have eſtabliſhed nothing, which is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the conſent of all the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.

For the confeſſions of particular Churches are not ſtreitned to fundamentals alone, but ſometimes are extended to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of their judgement of all heads of Divinity, as they conceive it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the Aedification of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in Truth, and Piety. Therefore their errour is not to be born with; who, what ever they finde in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, will have it counted ſo funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, that they feare not to ranke thoſe forreign Churches, which in all, and every thing, will not admit the ſame to be the Rule of ſaving Faith, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong damned Hereticks, overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Foundation; in a word, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt wicked men, eſtranged from the holy brotherhood of good Chriſtians.

Let us ſee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whether the Proteſtants agree ſo farre forth, and let us take example only from thoſe three controverſies; Of the Preſence of the Body and bloud of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> Of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Properties in the perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> God and man; Of Divine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and preterition, according to the good pleaſure of the Divine will.

                     <p>Thirdly, nothing remaineth unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided in this Controverſie, which can be called a Fundamentall point, or for which the Brotherly Communion of Churches cannot be eſtabliſhed. For that word <hi>Orally,</hi> which is uſed of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and is diſallowed of other Churches, is ſo uſed of theſe, that they bring in no Fundamentall errour, and is ſo rejected of thoſe, that they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw no fundamentall Doctrine. For they that defend the <hi>Orall</hi> eating, as well of the Body of Chriſt, as of the bread, notwithſtanding denie ſuch a Preſence of the Body of Chriſt, as is Locall to mens mouthes, without which an <hi>Orall</hi> eating cannot properly be performed. For that body cannot be eaten with the mouth, betwixt which and mens mouthes there is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a great diſtance of place; That cannot be eaten with the mouth of the Body, which is ſo preſent to the place of the mouth, that it is not locally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the mouth. When therefore they allow of ſuch a diſtance, and give
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54675:100"/>ſuch a Location to the Body of Chriſt, it is plaine, that they paſſe and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the <hi>Orall</hi> eating, which is truly, and properly affirmed of the bread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, by a new, and figurative manner of ſpeech, to the Fleſh of Chriſt local<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remaining in the Heavens, and not locally preſent to the mouthes of men. Moreover, when they remove from this <hi>Orall</hi> eating, all champing and chewing of the body of Chriſt, the letting down of the thing chewed into the ſtomack, the increaſing and nouriſhing of the body of man by this fleſh thus chewed, it is evident, however they thinke fit to retaine this forme of ſpeech, yet they meane nothing by this Orall eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is joyned with the <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naites,</hi> rending of the Fleſh of Chriſt with their teeth, or agreeable with the ſignification of the words, as they ſound to mens eares in the Latine. They only ſeeme to deſire to affirme this; That this Orall eating, which truly, properly, uſually, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, is affirmed of the eating of the Bread, may, by the force of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated bread comming between, by a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54675:101"/>new, unuſuall, myſticall, and plainly heavenly ſignification of Orall eating, be fitted, and applyed to the Fleſh of Chriſt. Now as touching thoſe who on the other ſide contend, That the eating of the Fleſh of Chriſt, is not to be called an Orall eating, but rather a Mentall, Spirituall, or Perſonall; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Perſon eating the bread with his mouth, with his minde toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eates the true and lively fleſh of Chriſt: Yet they denie not, but that the viſible bread is the Inſtrument, or means appointed by Chriſt, which the perſon uſeth to the cating of the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible bread; but they thinke, that the eating of that thing is properly called Orall, which may be done by the Teeth, and inſtruments in the mouth: but that the eating of that thing cannot be called Orall, which is neither locally preſent to the mouth neither, if it were preſent, could it be ſubject to any Act of mans mouth, becauſe of the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and impaſſible nature which it hath. Betwixt theſe Opinions, I ſee ſome contrariety about the propriety of words, and phraſe of ſpeech, but of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54675:101"/>the maine, and of the Truth of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Faith, either none at all, or at leaſt ſo little, that notwithſtanding, there may be place for the eſtabliſhing of Brotherly Communion betwixt the Churches.

In theſe things wherein we have the opinions of all Proteſtant Churches ſo well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing, I dare not ſay, that nothing is wanting which belongs to knowledge in divinity, yet I confidently affirme, That there is nothing deficient which pertaines to the Catholike Faith, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is neceſſary to be knowne, and beleeved to the Salvation of a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54675:102"/>Chriſtian man; Laſtly, nothing which argues either theſe, or thoſe to have ſtarted aſunder from the Foundation, or that they ought to ſtart from mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Communion. If therefore in this Controverſie of the Perſon of Chriſt, and Properties of his Natures, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſome knotty things, which are more ſmoothly to be explained; Let Divines afford their helping hand to this matter, and not for this thing rend their Churches in pieces; Let them kindly bring back their wandring Brethren into the way, let them not furiouſly break aſunder the bands of Brotherly Unity: Let them build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fundamentall Doctrines their owne Gold, Silver, or Pretious ſtones, and let them throw downe the hay, and ſtubble built up by others; Let them not thruſt downe others from the Foundation, nor disjoynt themſelves from thoſe whom they themſelves ſee ſtick faſt to the Foundation, and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Articles.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, what hath been ſaid of the joynt Conſent in Fundamentalls, may be plainly ſeene, if we weigh all
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54675:103"/>thoſe Hereſies that ever oppoſed the Fundamentall Articles of the Perſon of Chriſt, and overturned the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans ſalvation. For they who damne, and curſe all theſe, cannot be accuſed of violating the Foundation, except by Slander, cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned but by high injuſtice. But now it is well knowne, that no Hereſie can be reckoned up, whether ancient or moderne, againſt which all the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches are not moſt ready to bring their voice to condemne them.</p>
                        <p>In the Conference at <hi>Lipſigh</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have often made mention for the hope it gave to us of renewing of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) all the ſpeakers with joynt conſent,

                           <hi>That opinions unknown to the ancient church, although at this time they be generaly received yet are no Doctrines of the Catholik Church:</hi> much leſſe ſuch Fundamentall doctrines, as are of force before God to break the Peace &amp; Unity of Churches.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, in this matter of the Perſon of Chriſt, and communication of his Properties, that thoſe things are not fundamentall, which as yet hang unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided may appear, from the very terms and words, which Divines are conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to uſe to expreſſe their opinion. For in fundamentalls, we heare Plaine &amp; cleer propoſitions: ſuch as theſe are.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Chriſt</hi> God and Man, the humane and divine nature, are moſt neerly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together: each nature in <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                           <pb n="140" facs="tcp:54675:104"/>hath, and retaines its owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties.</p>
                        <p>The proprieties of one nature, can never be made the proprieties of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature. In the perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> there is a Communication of Properties, by which that is attributed, and aſcribed to the whole Perſon, which is proper to one of his natures? As when we ſay, <hi>God was crucified for us,</hi> or, <hi>the Man Chriſt is Omnipotent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In this Communication, the divine nature neither powreth forth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of its Divinity, nor infuſeth them into the humane nature.</p>
                        <p>Theſe and all other things, which are cleerly ſpoken of the Perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Communication of his Properties are contradicted by none. But thoſe things which are conceived, and infol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ſtrange, forreign, and doubtfull termes, beget ſtrifes upon ſtrifes, and queſtions upon queſtions. Such are thoſe Problems, Whether the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Natures, in the Perſon of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be communicated only verbally, or really; Whether they bee commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated in the abſtract, or the concrete,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54675:104"/>and others of the ſame ſtampe: which, by the very ſound of the words, doe appeare to have ſprung out of the Schoole of Grammarians and Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, not of the Apoſtles, and ancient Fathers, and therefore not to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in the number of fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls.</p>
                        <p>But let us adde ſome few things of the queſtions themſelves. That ſome affirme that this queſtion is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Whethere there be ſuch an Union of natures in the perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in which neither nature communicates any thing to the other, beſides the bare name; they ſeem to me to feigne a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion which never was betwixt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches. For with one voice they confeſſe; That ſuch is the Union of the natures in the Perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in which many things are communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the humane Nature, yea all things, although excellent gifts, whereof a created nature can be a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject capable to receive them. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as no Proteſtant, corrupteth this Propoſition, <hi>The Man Chriſt is God,</hi> with this wicked Interpretation, <hi>The
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54675:105"/>Man Chriſt hath the bare, and empty title of God.</hi> So neither doe any deprave this propoſition, <hi>The Man Chriſt is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> with this perverſe expoſition, <hi>The Man Chriſt is in word only or title Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent:</hi> but acknowledgeth the matter it ſelfe, which is ſignified in this <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate,</hi> truly, and really to agree to the Man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe it truly agrees to his perſon, which the terme <hi>Man</hi> doth deſigne and denote. They which on the other ſide defend, that it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truly ſaid, of the Man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he is Omnipotent, <hi>Omniſcient, &amp;c.</hi> but alſo that of the humane nature of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that the ſame is <hi>Omnipotent, Omniſcient, &amp;c.</hi> yet doe ſo temper, and explaine this their opinion, that they deny theſe divine properties to bee powered into the humane nature, or ever become properties fixed, and ſetled in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature; and determine them only by the perſonall Union, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation that followed upon it, to be attributed to him in his Perſon, and not ſeverally. If there be any difference, betwixt theſe Opinion, it is ſo ſubtle, ſo farre removed from the capacity,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54675:105"/>and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon underſtanding of Chriſtian people, that it cannot be in the number of fundamentall Doctrines, except we will faine a new kinde of fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, hitherto unknown, and unheard of to the Catholike Church, and people of God.</p>
                        <p>As concerning other queſtions, which thoſe foure words, have bred unto us, <hi>Verbally, Really, in the Concrete, in the Abſtract,</hi> we may freely ſay, ſuch termes of Art ought not to enter into the articles of the Chriſtian Faith; from the knowledge wherof depends, the life and Salvation, not only of learned men, and Logicians, but of the unlearned, and of all common Chriſtians: Moreover, it is little ſuteable, that we ſhould ſeek fundamentall Doctrines in Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as long, as it is not agreed on, of the ſenſe and ſignification of the termes, which are uſed in the framing of them. But what comes to be underſtood,
<note place="margin">

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54675:106"/>well agree in the ſignification of theſe words, when they are referred to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Therefore it is enough for the retaining of Unity betwixt Churches, that all acknowledge the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Properties, not to be verball, but reall, ſo farre forth as that the ſame and one only Perſon to whom it is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, is truly and really God, is alſo truly and really man, and therefore things may really be predicated of God which belong to Man, and of the Man Chriſt, which belong to God.</p>
                        <p>But if we ſhould change the name of God, into Godhead; or Man, into Manhood; all alſo will acknowledge, that the Propoſitions are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with the ſame certainty; None will doubt of this Propoſition.</p>
                        <p>God was Crucified for our ſins:</p>
                        <p>But if it be thus altered.</p>
                        <p>The Godhead or Divine Nature was Crucified for our ſins,</p>
                        <p>It will afford occaſion, not only of doubting, but of being deceived. So this Propoſition is placed, without the reach of all queſtion.</p>

                        <p>The Manhood or humane nature of Chriſt is omnipotent, omnipreſent, &amp;c. it will not appeare ſo plainly, to the Orthodox in their Judgement.

Let the places noted on the margin be conſulted with. Alſo <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe in <hi>Hoſpinian,</hi> hath many things moſt worthy to bee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, of the Perſon of Chriſt, and communication of his Attributes, and moſt to the purpoſe, for the true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this queſtion: I will adde this one thing, that thoſe two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
<q>
                              <l>The Man Chriſt is God,</l>
                              <l>The God Chriſt is Man.</l>
                           </q> Which are the foundation of all the reſt, in which this communication of Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes (whereof the ſtrife is) is made, are above and againſt all rules of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians and Philoſophers. In vaine therefore doe we leane to the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencies of Logick, when we endeavor,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54675:107"/>to annex other new fundamentalls unto them: we doe it in tearing and rending the unity of the Churches, when they cannot ſee alike the force of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequencies. For thoſe which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and embrace the truth of all fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, in this queſtion about the Perſon of Chriſt, are not to be caſt off from other Churches, for every error in the manner of ſpeech, or ignorance in the manner of inferring or deducing of conſequencies. Now in the laſt place, let us briefely ſee what is to be determined in that controverſie, which is about divine Predeſtination.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>Of Divine Predeſtination.</head>
                        <p>AS concerning this controverſie, many things in the very heat of diſputation, have fallen from ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Doctors of great account, which ſeem not to agree ſquare to the exact rule of Truth. But theſe things ought not to be urged, to the breaking aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Unity, and Communion of the Churches, if once it appeare to all Proteſtant Churches, that, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54675:107"/>whatſoever in this matter is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be believed unto Salvation, and that all errors are rejected of all, which croſſe and oppoſe Mans Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be obtained by Chriſt. Look into all the Confeſſions of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, you ſhall finde nothing left out of them, which may be called fundamentall; nothing put into them, which overthroweth any fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Article. All doe conſent, that none is elected or Predeſtinated from Eternity to Salvation, except out of the meer, and moſt free mercy and grace of God; that none in time is brought to Salvation or Eternall Life, except by the way of Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and new Obedience. Alſo all grant, that God from Eternity, did as well decree to give to the Elect, as he did foreſee all thoſe ſaving goods ſhould bee given them, by helpe whereof they are brought to Eternall Life; That he did alſo decree, ſo to give to them, and did foreſee that this ſaving grace ſhould ſo bee given, that they cannot boaſt of any cauſe, or occaſion found, or foreſeen in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54675:108"/>of this Gods bounty unto them. Laſtly, they grant that all the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which ſingle perſons have, or ought to have to eternall Life, ought not to be ſought <hi>a Priori,</hi> beginning at the Top in the Decree, or Preſcience of God; but <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> beginning at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, in the fruits of Faith and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And moreover, they conclude this, That the Elect themſelves cannot be ſuſtained or refreſhed with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of their electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or ſalvation, when, and as long as they wander out of the way of Salvation, becauſe <hi>the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> will not <hi>beare witneſſe to their hearts,</hi>

                           <hi>that they are the ſonnes and heires of God,</hi> but when <hi>they are led by the Spirit of God.</hi> But men cannot have a ſure and firme comfort of their Election and Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except the Spirit witneſſe this unto their ſpirits.</p>
                        <p>Now as touching, that Paſſing men by, or not Electing them, which is commonly called Reprobation; I ſee nothing Fundamentall whereof there is any diſſention betwixt the Reformed Churches. If as yet all things be not well agreed on betwixt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54675:108"/>particular Doctors, Let them ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their Armes, and uſe their ſtrength, that they pluck not aſunder the Churches themſelves with a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Schiſme. The Authors of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Confeſſion, in the XVII. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, where Predeſtination is handled, would not ſo much as in a word touch upon the other Queſtion of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both becauſe of the uſeleſſe ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which mens curioſitie would extract thence, as alſo becauſe out of the Doctrine of Predeſtination well grounded, ſo much may eaſily be gathered as is neceſſary or profitable to know or hold of Reprobation. But neither for this thing is there cauſe to diſſolve the Brotherly Union betwixt Proteſtants. All grant and agree, that theſe Propoſitions are moſt true.</p>
                        <p>That the Act of Reprobation in God, as that of Election, is from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                        <p>That none is Reprobated from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, which might not be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated without all Cruelty or Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
                        <p>That no one was fore-damned of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54675:109"/>God from Eternitie, whom he from Eternitie did not foreſee wrapt up in the guilt of damnation.</p>
                        <p>That no one ſhall in time be damned, but through the moſt juſt merit of his owne corruption and impiety.</p>
                        <p>That the Originall, and cauſe of all Evills, which drownes Reprobates in perdition, is not found in God Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating, but in the Reprobates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                        <p>That this Eternall Reprobation cannot appeare to any particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, unleſſe out of the fruits moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of damnation, which he brings forth, and loves to bring forth to the end of his life.</p>
                        <p>That there is no ſingle Perſon, which may not attaine Eternall Life, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, Beleeving, and Perſevering, according to the Tenor of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Goſpell.</p>
                        <p>That there is no ſuch Decree of God, by which Reprobates ſhould be forced, and neceſſitated to ſinne and periſh; But alwayes they periſh by their own voluntary unbeliefe, and impiety, free, and not conſtrained.</p>
                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:54675:109"/>
                        <p>It appeared lately in the Conference of <hi>Lipſigh,</hi> that there is an agreement in all theſe Points. If there be any other things remaining, they are rather Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies about words, than about matter; rather diſcords about ſubtile Speculations, than fundamentall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. Such are thoſe which are diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted betwixt Schoolmen, of the Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the very words, namely <hi>Predeſtination</hi> and <hi>Reprobation;</hi> of the Imaginary order of Priority, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriority betwixt the Eternall Acts of Predeſtinating, and Fore-knowing of the unſearchable manner of Divine working about all humane Actions, whether good or bad, of the neceſſitie, or Contingency of all things, which from Eternity were predeſtinated, or fore-knowne of God. In ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed Controverſies, it cannot bee, but contradictions muſt ariſe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times betwixt Diſputants: Yet brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Concord, may be made up, and maintained betwixt the Churches themſelves, as anciently it was preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved betwixt the <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Churches, Their Doctors in the mean

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54675:111"/>that alwaies of it ſelfe it is of force to impaire the Glory of God in ſome part. But that to me ſeems weak and unfound, which both ſides preſume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as on a thing to be granted, and not at all to be denyed, Namely, that it tendeth to the Glory of God, for us to renounce Brotherly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with thoſe Churches, wherein Doctrines are defended in ſome manner, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree croſſing the glory of God. Thoſe things which ſo ſhake the Glory of God, that they ſuffer not at all thoſe which are erroneous in them, to have ſaving Communion with God, and Chriſt, neither doe they ſuffer Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Chriſtians to retaine Brotherly Communion with them. But thoſe things which in ſome meaſure are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the truth of the Scriptures, and glory of God, but yet doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſaid Communion, can in no wiſe afford to any particular Church juſt cauſe of departing and dividing it ſelfe from another: for this is the very ſelfe ſame fault, which the Ancients en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to render odious to all, under the infamous name of Schiſme. But that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54675:112"/>alſo may be added, that the Churches which are in the right, doe well enough diſcharge their dutyes, when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and take care, that their owne People be not intangled in the errors of others, when they endeavor with all gentleneſſe to reduce the wandring Churches into the way of Truth. But when they depart from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Brotherly Unity of the Church, from which Chriſt hitherto hath not departed, they defend not, but grievouſly wound the glory of God and Chriſt, by this their ſeparation. Laſtly, when the far greater part of particular Churches, conſiſts not of learned Doctors, but of ſimple people, it cannot truly be affirmed, that they underſtand the Errours propagated by the learned, much leſſe that they ſtick to them, leaſt of all that they ſtick to them with obſtinacy and wilfulneſſe. Therefore under pretence of theſe, the bands of Chriſtian Brotherhood are not to be broken betwixt whole Churches. <hi>For Jeruſalem is built as a city which is at unity in it ſelf,</hi> and which wil take it in very ill part, that her parts
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54675:112"/>are pluckt, and broken aſunder on any colour whatſoever. We aſcribe it therefore to be an act of Piety, that they are fearefull to ſin againſt the Glory of God; but wee account it to be from want of wiſedome, that they eſteeme the diviſion of the Proteſtant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as either a neceſſary, or fit, or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes to the advancing of the Glory of God.</p>

Hitherto it may be added (which all men skilled in controverſies, know to be moſt true) that thoſe foule Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, which the Proteſtants charge one another with, for the moſt part are not expreſly found in the writings of the Doctors themſelves, nor are affirmed of them in very words, but are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly racked, out of other words of theirs, by, I know not what, ſmall threads of conſequencies, whileſt they themſelves diſclaim them, &amp; curſe ſuch Hereſies from their whole heart.

Neither in the mean time doe they derogate any thing from their owne confeſſion, or favor, and Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize a ſtrange one; but they doe not at all challenge to themſelves the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of dividing of Churches, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of Brotherly Union betwixt Chriſtians, from that cauſe which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt nor the Apoſtles, nor the Primitive Church would ever have approved. Laſtly, the Example fetch'd from the <hi>Arians,</hi> is altogether divers, and farre off from the matter in hand; for we willingly grant, that Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Communion is to be denyed to them, not onely of ſome one particular Church, but even of all, who durſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the Eternall divinity of Chriſt; For this is to overturne the moſt ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Chriſtian Faith, and mans
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54675:120"/>Salvation. But far different is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and nature of thoſe Controverſies which are diſputed of in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches, and in which they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and diſagree amongſt themſelves; For in none of theſe can any truly ſay, That either the Foundation of mans ſalvation is overthrown, or the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Catholike Church contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or laſtly, that any particular Church ever was for errors in ſuch points ſeparated, or to be ſeparated from the Brotherly Communion of all Chriſtians, by the Judgement and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Catholike Church. But this ſeems to have no doubt at all in it, that one particular Church doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly cut off any other from her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, when for the ſame opinions, according to the ancient diſcipline of the Catholike Church, and rules Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikely eſtabliſhed, ſhe was not to be cut and caſt off from all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                     <p>But through the love of Peace, and deſire of renewing concord betwixt moſt famous Churches, I am carried much farther, than at firſt I propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54675:120"/>to my ſelfe. I will now turne my Speech to God himſelf; whom I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech, that at laſt he would be pleaſed to binde up the differences of all the Proteſtant Churches, and to make them up into one, and that he would ſhew unto all, That it agrees with the nature of this One God, to be worſhipped in Unity. Now I take my farewell of my moſt deare Brethren of the forrain Churches, with the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of moſt holy <hi>Auguſtine, If you will live of the Holy Spirit, hold Charity, love Verity, deſire <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, that you may come to Eternity.</hi> To the God of heaven, who is the God of Peace; to Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, who is the Prince of Peace; to the Holy Spirit, who is the Bond of Peace, be Glory, Honor, and Thankeſgiving, for ever, and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
